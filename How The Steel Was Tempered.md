How The Steel Was Tempered

Part One Chapter 1
---

"Those of you who came to my house to be examined before the Easter holidays, stand up!"The speaker, a corpulent man in the garb of a priest, with a heavy cross dangling from his neck,fixed the class with a baleful glare.

His small hard eyes seemed to bore through the six children—four boys and two girls—who rose from their seats and looked at the man in the robe with apprehension.

"You sit down," the priest said, motioning to the girls.

The girls hastily complied, with sighs of relief.

Father Vasili's slits of eyes focussed on the other four.

"Now then, my fine lads, come over here!"

Father Vasili rose, pushed back his chair and walked up to the group of boys who stood huddled close together.

"Which of you young ruffians smokes?"

"We don't smoke, father," the four answered timidly.

The blood rushed to the priest's face.

"You don't smoke, eh, you scoundrels? Then who put the tobacco in the dough? Tell me that!

We'll see whether you smoke or not. Now then, turn out your pockets! Come on, turn them out, I say!"

Three of the boys proceeded to empty the contents of their pockets onto the table. 

The priest inspected the seams carefully for grains of tobacco, but found nothing, whereupon he turned to the fourth lad, a dark-eyed youngster in a grey shirt and blue trousers patched at the knees. 

"What are you standing there for like a dummy?" 

The lad threw a look of silent hatred at his questioner. 

"I haven't any pockets," he replied sullenly, running his hands over the sides of his trousers. 

"No pockets, eh? You think I don't know who could have played such a scoundrelly trick as to spoil my dough? 

You think I'm going to let you off again? Oh no, my boy, you shall suffer for this. Last time I allowed you to stay in this school because your mother begged me to keep you, but now I'm finished with you. Out with you!" He seized the boy painfully by the ear and threw him out into the corridor, slamming the door after him. 

The class sat silent, cowed. None of the children could understand why Pavel Korchagin had been ejected, none but Sergei Bruzzhak, who was Pavel's closest friend. He had seen him sprinkle a fistful of home-grown tobacco into the Easter cake dough in the priest's kitchen where six backward pupils had waited for the priest to come and hear them repeat their lesson. 

Now Pavel sat down on the bottom step of the school-house and wondered dismally what his mother would say when he told her what had happened, his poor hard-working mother who toiled from morning till night as cook at the excise inspector's. 

Tears choked him. 

"What shall I do? It's all because of that damned priest. What on earth made me go and put that tobacco in his dough? It was Seryozhka's idea. 'Let's play a trick on the old beast,' he says. So we did. And now Seryozhka's got off and I'll likely be kicked out." 

His feud with Father Vasili was of long standing. It dated back to the day he had a scrap with Mishka Levchenkov and in punishment was kept in after lessons. To keep the lad out of mischief in the empty classroom, the teacher took him to the second grade to sit in at a lesson. 

Pavel took a seat at the back. The teacher, a wizened little man in a black jacket, was telling the class about the earth and the heavenly bodies, and Pavel gaped with amazement when he learned that the earth had been in existence for millions of years and that the stars too were worlds. So startled was he by what he had heard that he barely refrained from getting up and blurting out: 

"That isn't what the Bible says!" But he was afraid of getting into more hot water. 

The priest had always given Pavel full marks for Scripture. He knew almost the whole prayer book practically by heart, and the Old and New Testament as well. He knew exactly what God had created on each day of the week. Now he resolved to take the matter up with Father Vasili. At the very next lesson, before the priest had time to settle himself properly in his chair, Pavel raised his hand and, having obtained permission to speak, he got up. 

"Father, why does the teacher in the second grade say the earth is millions of years old, instead of what the Bible says, five thou. . . ." A hoarse cry from Father Vasili cut him short. 

"What did you say, you scoundrel? So that's how you learn your Scripture!" 

And before Pavel knew what had happened the priest had seized him by the ears and was banging his head against the wall. A few minutes later, shaken with fright and pain, he found himself outside in the corridor. 

His mother too had given him a good scolding that time. And the following day she had gone to the school and begged Father Vasili to take him back. From that day Pavel hated the priest with all his soul. Hated and feared him. His childish heart rebelled against any injustice, however slight. 

He could not forgive the priest for the undeserved beating, and he grew sullen and bitter. 

Pavel suffered many a slight at the hands of Father Vasili after that. The priest was forever sending him out of the classroom; day after day for weeks on end he made him stand in the corner for trifling misdemeanours and never called on him to answer questions, with the result that on the eve of the Easter holidays Pavel had to go with the backward boys to the priest's house to be reexamined. It was there in the kitchen that he had dropped the tobacco into the dough. 

No one had seen him do it, but the priest had guessed at once who was to blame. 

The lesson ended at last and the children poured out into the yard and crowded round Pavel, who maintained a gloomy silence. Sergei Bruzzhak lingered behind in the classroom. He felt that he too was guilty, but he could do nothing to help his friend. 

Yefrem Vasilievich, the headmaster, poked his head out of the open window of the common room and shouted: "Send Korchagin to me at once!" Pavel jumped at the sound of the headmaster's deep bass voice, and with pounding heart obeyed his summons. 

The proprietor of the railway station restaurant, a pale middle-aged man with faded, colourless eyes, glanced briefly at Pavel. "How old is he?" "Twelve." 

"All right, he can stay. He'll get eight rubles a month and his food on the days he works. He'll work twenty-four hours at a stretch every other day. But mind, no pilfering." 

"Oh no, sir. He won't steal, I'll answer for that," the mother hastened fearfully to assure him. 

"Let him start in today," ordered the proprietor and, turning to the woman behind the counter, said: "Zina, take the boy to the kitchen and tell Frosya to put him to work instead of Grishka." 

The barmaid laid down the knife with which she had been slicing ham, nodded to Pavel and led the way across the hall to a side door opening into the scullery. Pavel followed her. His mother hurried after him and whispered quickly into his ear: "Now Pavlushka, dear, do your best, and don't disgrace yourself." 

With sad eyes she watched him go, and left. Work in the scullery was in full swing; plates, forks and knives were piled high on the table and several women were wiping them with towels flung over their shoulders. A boy slightly older than Pavel, with a shaggy mop of ginger hair, was tending two huge samovars. 

The scullery was full of steam that rose from the large vat of boiling water in which the dishes were washed, and Pavel could not see the faces of the women at first. He stood waiting uncertainly for someone to tell him what to do. 

Zina., the barmaid, went over to one of the dishwashers and touched her shoulder. 

"Here, Frosya, I've brought you a new boy to take Grishka's place. You tell him what he's to do." 

"She's in charge here," Zina said to Pavel, nodding toward the woman she had called Frosya. 

"She'll tell you what you have to do." And with that she turned and went back to the buffet. 

"All right," Pavel replied softly and looked questioningly at Frosya. Wiping her perspiring brow she examined him critically from head to foot, then, rolling up her sleeve which had slipped over her elbow, she said in a deep and remarkably pleasant voice:

"It's not much of a job, dearie, but it will keep you busy enough. That copper over there has to be heated in the morning and kept hot so there's boiling water all the time; then there's the wood to chop and the samovars to take care of besides. You'll have to clean the knives and forks sometimes and carry out the slops. There'll be plenty to do, lad," she said, speaking with a marked Kostroma accent laying the stress on the "a's". Her manner of speaking and her flushed face with the small turned-up nose made Pavel feel better.

"She seems quite decent," he concluded, and overcoming his shyness, said: "What am I to do now,Auntie?"

A loud guffaw from the dishwashers met his words.

"Ha! Ha! Frosya's gone and got herself a nephew. . . ."

Frosya herself laughed even more heartily than the others.

Through the cloud of steam Pavel had not noticed that Frosya was a young girl; she was no more than eighteen.

Much embarrassed, he turned to the boy and asked:

"What do I do now?"

But the boy merely chuckled. "You ask Auntie, she'll tell you all about it. I'm off." Whereupon he darted through the door leading to the kitchen.

"Come over here and help dry the forks," said one of the dishwashers, a middle-aged woman.

"Stop your cackling," she admonished the others. "The lad didn't say anything funny. Here, take this." She handed Pavel a dish towel. "Hold one end between your teeth and pull the other end tight. Here's a fork, run it up and down the towel, and see you don't leave any dirt between the prongs. They're very strict about that here. The customers always inspect the forks and if they find a speck of dirt, they make a terrible fuss, and the mistress will send you flying out in a jiffy."

"The mistress?" Pavel echoed. "I thought the master who hired me was in charge."

The dishwasher laughed.

"The master, my lad, is just a stick of furniture around here. The mistress is the boss. She isn't here today. But if you work here a while you'll see for yourself."

The scullery door opened and three waiters entered carrying trays piled high with dirty dishes.

One of them, a broad-shouldered cross-eyed man with a heavy, square jaw, said: "You'd better look lively. The 12 o'clock is due any minute, and here you are dawdling about."

He looked at Pavel. "Who's this?" he asked.

"That's the new boy," said Frosya.

"Ah, the new boy," he said. "Well, listen, my lad." He laid his heavy hands on Pavel's shoulders and pushed him over to the samovars. "You're supposed to keep them boiling all the time, and look, one of them's out, and the other is barely going. Don't let it happen again or I'll beat the stuffings out of you!"

Pavel busied himself with the samovars without a word.

Thus began his life of toil. Never had Pavka worked so hard as on that first day. He realised that this was not home where he could afford to disobey his mother. The cross-eyed waiter had made it quite plain that if he did not do as he was told, he would suffer for it.

Placing one of his top-boots over the chimney and using it as a bellows, Pave! soon had the sparks flying from the large pot-bellied samovars. He picked up the slop pail and rushed out to the garbage dump, added firewood to the water boiler, dried the wet dish towels on the hot samovars —in a word, did everything he was told to do. Late that night when he went off wearily to the kitchen, Anisia, the middle-aged dishwasher, with a glance at the door that had closed behind him,remarked: "Something queer about that boy, look at the way he dashes about like mad. Must have been a good reason for putting him to work."

"He's a good worker," said Frosya. "Needs no speeding up."

"He'll soon cool off," was Lusha's opinion. "They all try hard in the beginning. . . ."

At seven o'clock the next morning, Pavel, utterly exhausted after a whole night spent on his feet,turned the boiling samovars over to the boy who was to relieve him. The latter, a puffy-faced youngster with a mean look in his eyes, examined the boiling samovars, and having assured himself that all was in order, thrust his hands into his pockets and spat through his teeth with an air of scornful superiority.

"Now listen, snotnose!" he said in an aggressive tone, fixing Pavel with his colourless eyes. "See you're on the job here tomorrow at six sharp."

"Why at six?" Pavka wanted to know. "The shift changes at seven, doesn't it?"

"Never mind when the shift changes. You get here at six. And you'd better not blab too much or I'll smash your silly mug for you. Some cheek, only started in today and already putting on airs."

The dishwashers who had just finished their shift listened with interest to the exchange between the two boys. The blustering tone and bullying manner of the other enraged Pavel. He took a step toward his tormentor and was about to lash out at him with his fists when the fear of losing his newly acquired job stopped him.

"Stop your noise," he said, his face dark with rage, "and keep off or you'll get more than you bargained for. I'll be here at seven tomorrow, and I can use my fists as good as you can. Maybe you'd like to try? I'm game."

His adversary cowered back against the boiler, gaping with surprise at the bristling Pavel. He had not expected such a determined rebuff.

"All right, all right, we'll see," he muttered.

Pavel, his first day at work having passed without mishap, hurried home with a sense of having honestly earned his rest. Now he too was a worker and no one could accuse him of being a parasite.

The morning sun was already climbing above the sprawling buildings of the sawmill. Before long the tiny house where Pavel lived would come into view, just behind the Leszczinski garden.

"Mother must have just got up, and here I am coming home from work," Pavel thought, and he quickened his pace, whistling as he went. "It turned out not so bad being kicked out of school.

That damned priest wouldn't have given me any peace anyway, and he can go to hell now for all I care. As for that gingerhead," he said to himself as he opened the gate, "I'll punch his face for certain."

His mother, who was lighting the samovar in the yard, looked up at her son's approach and asked anxiously:

"Well, how was it?"

"Fine," Pavel replied.

His mother was about to say something when through the open window Pavel caught a glimpse of his brother Artem's broad back.

"Artem's come home?" he asked, worried.

"Yes, he came last night. He's going to stay here and work at the railway yards."

With some hesitation Pavel opened the front door.

The man seated at the table with his back to the door turned his huge frame as Pavel entered and the eyes under the thick black brows looked stern.

"Ah, here comes the tobacco lad. Well, how goes it?"

Pavel dreaded the forthcoming interview.

"Artem knows all about it already," he thought. "I'm in for a good row and hiding to boot." Pavel stood somewhat in awe of his elder brother.

But Artem evidently had no intention of beating him. He sat on a stool, leaning his elbows on the table, and studied Pavel's face with a mingled expression of amusement and scorn.

"So you've graduated from university, eh? Learned all there is to learn and now you're busying yourself with slops, eh?"

Pavel stared down at a nail sticking out of a floor board. Artem got up from the table and went into the kitchen.

"Looks as if I won't get a thrashing after all," Pavel thought with a sigh of relief.

Later on at tea Artem questioned Pavel about the incident at school. Pavel told him all that had happened.

"What will become of you if you grow up to be such a scamp," the mother said sadly. "What shall we do with him? Who does he take after, I wonder? Dear God, to think of all I've had to suffer from that boy," she complained.

Artem pushed his empty cup away and turned to Pavel.

"Now listen to me, mate," he said. "What's done can't be undone. Only now take care and do your work properly and no monkey business, because if you get yourself kicked out of this place I'll give you a proper thrashing. Remember that. You've given mother enough trouble as it is. You're always getting into some sort of mess. Now that's got to stop. When you've worked for a year or thereabouts I'll try and get you taken on at the railway yards as an apprentice, because you'll never amount to anything if you mess about with slops all your life. You've got to learn a trade. You're a bit too young just now, but in a year's time I'll see what I can do, maybe they'll take you. I'll be working here now. Ma won't need to go out to work any more. She's slaved enough for all sorts of swine. Only see here, Pavel, you've got to be a man."

He stood up, his huge frame dwarfing everything about him, and putting on the jacket that hung over the chair, said to his mother: "I've got to go out for an hour or so," and went out, stooping in the doorway.

Passing by the window on his way to the gate, he looked in and called out to Pavel: "I've brought you a pair of boots and a knife. Mother will give them to you."

The station restaurant was open day and night.

Six different railway lines met at this junction, and the station was always packed with people;only for two or three hours at night during a gap between trains was the place comparatively quiet.

Hundreds of trains passed through this station bringing maimed and crippled men from the front and taking back a constant stream of new men in monotonous grey overcoats.

Pavel worked there for two years—two years in which he saw nothing more than the scullery and kitchen. The twenty odd people employed in the huge basement kitchen worked at a feverish pace.

Ten waiters scurried constantly back and forth between the restaurant and the kitchen. 

By now Pavel was receiving ten rubles instead of eight. He had grown taller and broader in these two years, and many were the trials that fell to his lot. For half a year he had worked as a kitchen boy but had been sent back to the scullery again by the all-powerful chef who had taken a dislike to him—you never knew but what the unruly cub might stick a knife into you if you beat him too often. Indeed Pavel's fiery temper would have lost him the job long since had it not been for his tremendous capacity for hard work. For he could work harder than anyone else and he never seemed to get tired. 

During rush hours he would dash with loaded trays up and down the kitchen stairs like a whirlwind, taking several steps at a time. 

At night, when the hubbub in both halls of the restaurant subsided, the waiters would gather downstairs in the kitchen storerooms and wild, reckless card games would begin. Pavel often saw large sums of money lying on the tables. He was not surprised, for he knew that each waiter received between thirty and forty rubles a shift in ruble and half ruble tips, which they spent later in drinking and gambling. Pavel hated them. 

"The damned swine!" he thought. "There's Artem, a first-class mechanic, and all he gets is forty-eight rubles a month, and I get ten. And they rake in all that money in one day, just for carrying trays back and forth. And then they spend it all on drink and cards." 

To Pavel the waiters were as alien and hostile as his employers. "They crawl on their bellies here, the pigs, but their wives and sons strut about town like rich folk." 

Sometimes their sons came, wearing smart Gymnasium uniforms, and sometimes their wives, plump and soft with good living. "I bet they have more money than the gentry they serve," Pavel thought. Nor was the lad shocked any longer by what went on at night in the dark corners of the kitchen or in the storerooms. He knew very well that no dishwasher or barmaid would hold her job long if she did not sell herself for a few rubles to those who held the whip hand here. 

Pavel, avid of life, had a glimpse of its bottom-most depths, the very sump of its ugly pit, and a musty, mouldy stench, the smell of swamp rot, rose up to him. 

Artem was unable to get him hired as an apprentice at the railway yards; they would not take anyone under fifteen. But Pavel was drawn to the huge soot-blackened brick building, and he looked forward to the day when he could get away from the restaurant. 

He went to see Artem at the yards frequently, and would go with him to look over the carriages, helping him whenever he could. 

He felt particularly lonely after Frosya left. With the gay, laughing girl gone, Pavel felt more keenly than ever how much her friendship had meant to him. Now when he came in the morning to the scullery and listened to the shrill quarrelling of the refugee women he felt a gnawing sense of emptiness and solitude.

During a slack period at night, as he squatted beside his boiler, adding firewood and staring at the flames, he fell to think of Frosya, and a scene he had recently witnessed rose before his mind's eye. 

During the night interval on Saturday Pavel was on his way downstairs to the kitchen, when curiosity prompted him to climb onto a pile of firewood to look into the storeroom on the lower landing where the gamblers usually assembled.

The game was in full swing. Zalivanov, flushed with excitement, was keeping the bank.

Just then footsteps sounded on the stairs. Looking around, Pavel saw Prokhoshka coming down,and he slipped under the staircase to let the man pass into the kitchen. It was dark there under the stairs and Prokhoshka could not see him.

As Prokhoshka passed the turning in the stairs, Pavel caught a glimpse of his broad back and hugehead. Just then someone else came hurrying lightly down the steps after the waiter and Pavel heard a familiar voice call out:

"Prokhoshka, wait!"

Prokhoshka stopped and turned around to look up the stairway.

"What d'you want?" he growled.

The footsteps pattered down and soon Frosya came into sight.

She seized the waiter by the arm and spoke in a broken, choking voice.

"Where's the money the Lieutenant gave you, Prokhoshka?"

The man wrenched his arm away from her.

"What money? I gave it to you, didn't I?" His tone was sharp and vicious.

"But he gave you three hundred rubles," Frosya's voice broke into muffled sobs.

"Did he now? Three hundred!" Prokhoshka sneered. "Want to get it all, eh? Flying high for a dishwasher, aren't you, my fine young lady? The fifty I gave you is plenty. Girls a damn sight better than you, educated too, don't take that much. You ought to be thankful for what you got—fifty rubles clear for a night is damn good. All right, I'll give you another ten, maybe twenty, that's all— and if you're not a fool you can earn some more. I can help you." With this Prokhoshka turned and disappeared into the kitchen.

"Scoundrel! Swine!" Frosya screamed after him and, leaning against the woodpile, sobbed bitterly.

It is hard to describe what Pavel felt as he stood in the darkness under the staircase watching Frosya beat her head against the logs of wood. But he did not show himself; only his fingers spasmodically gripped the cast-iron supports of the staircase.

"So they've sold her too, damn them! Oh Frosya, Frosya. . . ."

His hatred for Prokhoshka seared deeper than ever and everything around him was revolting and hateful to him. "If I had the strength I'd beat the scoundrel to death! Why am I not big and strong like Artem?"

The flames under the boiler flared up and died down, their trembling red tongues intertwining into a long bluish spiral; it seemed to Pavel that some jeering, mocking imp was showing its tongue at him.

It was quiet in the room; only the fire crackled and the tap dripped at measured intervals.

Klimka put the last pot, scrubbed until it shone, on the shelf and wiped his hands. There was no one else in the kitchen. The cook on duty and the kitchen help were asleep in the cloakroom. Quiet settled over the kitchen for the three night hours, and these hours Klimka always spent upstairs with Pavel, for a firm friendship had sprung up between the young kitchen boy and the dark-eyed boiler attendant. Upstairs, Klimka found Pavel squatting in front of the open firebox. Pavel saw the shadow of the familiar shaggy figure cast against the wall and said without turning around:

"Sit down, Klimka."

The boy climbed onto the woodpile, stretched out on it and looked at the silent Pavel.

"Trying to tell your fortune in the fire?" he asked, smiling.

Pavel tore his gaze away from the licking tongues of flame and turned on Klimka two large shining eyes brimming over with sadness. Klimka had never seen his friend look so unhappy.

"What's wrong with you today, Pavel?" After a pause he asked: "Anything happened?" Pavel got up and sat next to Klimka. "Nothing's happened," he replied in a low voice. "Only I can't stand it here, Klimka." And his hands resting on his knees clenched into fists.

"What's come over you today?" Klimka insisted, propping himself up on his elbows.

"Today? It's been like this ever since I got this job. Just look at this place! We work like horses and instead of thanks we get blows—anyone can beat you and there's nobody to stick up for you.

The masters hire us to serve them, but anyone who's strong enough has the right to beat us. After all, you can run yourself ragged but you'll never please everybody and those you can't please always have it in for you. No matter how you try to do everything right so that nobody could find fault, there's always bound to be somebody you haven't served fast enough, and then you get it in the neck just the same. . . ."

"Don't shout like that," Klimka interrupted him, frightened. "Somebody might walk in and hear you." Pavel leapt to his feet.

"Let them hear, I'm going to quit anyway. I'd rather shovel snow than hang around this . . . this hole full of crooks. Look at all the money they've got! They treat us like dirt, and do what they like with the girls. The decent girls who won't do what they want are kicked out, and starving refugees who have no place to go are taken on instead. And that sort hang on because here at least they get something to eat, and they're so down and out they'll do anything for a piece of bread."

He spoke with such passion that Klimka, fearing that someone might overhear, sprang up to close the door leading to the kitchen, while Pavel continued to pour out the bitterness that burned inside him.

"And you, Klimka, take the beatings lying down. Why don't you ever speak up?"

Pavel dropped onto a stool at the table and rested his head wearily on the palm of his hand.

Klimka threw some wood into the fire and also sat down at the table.

"Aren't we going to read today?" he asked Pavel.

"There's nothing to read," Pavel replied. "The bookstall's closed."

"Why should it be closed today?" Klimka wondered.

"The gendarmes picked up the bookseller. Found something on him," Pavel replied.

"Picked him up? What for?"

"For .politics, they say."

Klimka stared at Pavel, unable to grasp his meaning.

"Politics. What's that?"

Pavel shrugged his shoulders.

"The devil knows! They say it's politics when you go against the tsar."

Klimka looked startled.

"Do people do that sort of thing?"

"I dunno," replied Pavel.

The door opened and Glasha, her eyelids puffed from sleepiness, walked into the scullery.

"Why aren't you two sleeping? There's time for an hour's nap before the train pulls in. You'd better take a rest, Pavel, I'll see to the boiler for you."

Pavel quit his job sooner than he expected and in a manner he had not foreseen.

One frosty January day when Pavel had finished his shift and was ready to go home he found that the lad who was to relieve him had not shown up. Pavel went to the proprietor's wife and announced that he was going nevertheless, but she would not hear of it. There was nothing for him to do but to carry on, exhausted though he was after a day and night of work. By evening he was ready to drop with weariness. During the night interval he had to fill the boilers and have them ready for the three-o'clock train.

Pavel turned the tap but there was no water; the pump evidently was not working. Leaving the tap open, he lay down on the woodpile to wait, but fatigue got the better of him, and he was soon fast asleep.

A few minutes later the tap began gurgling and hissing and the water poured into the boiler, filling it to overflowing and spilling over the tiled floor of the scullery which was deserted at this hour.

The water flowed on until it covered the floor and seeped under the door into the restaurant.

Puddles of water gathered under the bags and bundles of the dozing passengers, but nobody noticed it until the water reached a passenger lying on the floor and he jumped to his feet with a shout. There was a rush for luggage and a terrific uproar broke out.

And the water continued to pour in.

Prokhoshka, who had been clearing the tables in the second hall, ran in when he heard the commotion. Leaping over the puddles he made a dash for the door and pushed it open violently.

The water dammed behind it burst into the hall.

There was more shouting. The waiters on duty rushed into the scullery. Prokhoshka threw himself on the sleeping Pavel.

Blows rained down on the boy's head, stunning him.

Still half asleep, he had no idea of what was happening. He was only conscious of blinding flashes of lightning before his eyes and agonising pain shooting through his body.

Pavel was so badly beaten that he barely managed to drag himself home.

In the morning Artem, grim-faced and scowling, questioned his brother as to what had happened.

Pavel told him everything.

"Who beat you?" Artem asked hoarsely.

"Prokhoshka."

"All right, now lie still."

Without another word Artem pulled on his jacket and walked out.

"Where can I find Prokhor, the waiter?" he asked one of the dishwashers. Glasha stared at the stranger in workingman's clothes who had burst into the scullery.

"He'll be here in a moment," she replied.

The man leaned his enormous bulk against the door jamb.

"All right, I can wait."

Prokhor, carrying a mountain of dishes on a tray, kicked the door open and entered the scullery.

"That's him," Glasha nodded at the waiter.

Artem took a step forward and laying a heavy hand on Prokhor's shoulder looked him straight in the eye.

"What did you beat up my brother Pavka for?"

Prokhor tried to shake his shoulder loose, but a smashing blow laid him out on the floor; he tried to rise, but a second blow more terrible than the first pinned him down.

The frightened dishwashers scattered on all sides.

Artem turned and walked out.

Prokhoshka lay sprawled on the floor, his battered face bleeding.

That evening Artem did not come home -from the railway yards.

His mother learned that he was being held by the gendarmes.

Six days later Artem returned late at night when his mother was already asleep. He went up to Pavel, who was sitting up in bed, and said gently:

"Feeling better, boy?" Artem sat down next to Pavel. "Might have been worse." After a moment's silence he added: "Never mind, you'll go to work at the electric station; I've spoken to them about you. You'll learn a real trade there."

Pavel seized Artem's powerful hand with both of his.

“节前上我家去补考的，都给我站起来！”

一个脸皮松弛的胖神甫，身上穿着法衣，脖子上挂着沉甸甸的十字架，气势汹汹地瞪着全班的学生。

六个学生应声从板凳上站了起来，四个男生，两个女生。

神甫两只小眼睛闪着凶光，像要把他们一口吞下去似的。孩子们惊恐不安地望着他。

“你们俩坐下。”神甫朝女孩子挥挥手说。

她们急忙坐下，松了一口气。

瓦西里神甫那对小眼睛死盯在四个男孩子身上。

“过来吧，宝贝们！”

瓦西里神甫站起来，推开椅子，走到挤作一团的四个孩子跟前。

“你们这几个小无赖，谁抽烟？”

四个孩子都小声回答：“我们不会抽，神甫。”

神甫脸都气红了。

“混帐东西，不会抽，那发面里的烟末是谁撒的？都不会抽吗？好，咱们这就来看看！把口袋翻过来，快点！听见了没有？快翻过来！”

三个孩子开始把他们口袋里的东西掏出来，放在桌子上。

神甫仔细地检查口袋的每一条缝，看有没有烟末，但是什么也没有找到，便把目光转到第四个孩子身上。这孩子长着一对黑眼睛，穿着灰衬衣和膝盖打补丁的蓝裤子。

“你怎么像个木头人，站着不动弹？”

黑眼睛的孩子压住心头的仇恨，看着神甫，闷声闷气地回答：“我没有口袋。”他用手摸了摸缝死了的袋口。

“哼，没有口袋！你以为这么一来，我就不知道是谁干的坏事，把发面糟蹋了吗？你以为这回你还能在学校待下去吗？没那么便宜，小宝贝。上回是你妈求情，才把你留下的，这回可不行了。你给我滚出去！”他使劲揪住男孩子的一只耳朵，把他推到走廊上，随手关上了门。

教室里鸦雀无声，学生一个个都缩着脖子。谁也不明白保尔·柯察金为什么被赶出学校。只有他的好朋友谢廖沙·勃鲁扎克知道是怎么回事。那天他们六个不及格的学生到神甫家里去补考，在厨房里等神甫的时候，他看见保尔把一把烟末撒在神甫家过复活节用的发面里。

保尔被赶了出来，坐在门口最下一磴台阶上。他想，该怎么回家呢？母亲在税务官家里当厨娘，每天从清早忙到深夜，为他操碎了心，该怎么向她交代呢？

眼泪哽住了保尔的喉咙。

“现在我可怎么办呢？都怨这该死的神甫。我给他撒哪门子烟末呢？都是谢廖沙出的馊主意。他说，‘来，咱们给这个害人的老家伙撒上一把。’我们就撒进去了。谢廖沙倒没事，我可说不定要给撵出学校了。”

保尔跟瓦西里神甫早就结下了仇。有一回，他跟米什卡·列夫丘科夫打架，老师罚他留校，不准回家吃饭，又怕他在空教室里胡闹，就把这个淘气鬼送到高年级教室，让他坐在后面的椅子上。

高年级老师是个瘦子，穿着一件黑上衣，正在给学生讲地球和天体。他说地球已经存在好几百万年了，星星也跟地球差不多。保尔听他这样说，惊讶得张大了嘴巴。他感到非常奇怪，差点没站起来对老师说：“圣经上可不是这么说的。”

但是又怕挨骂，没敢做声。

保尔是信教的。她母亲是个教徒，常给他讲圣经上的道理。世界是上帝创造的，而且并非几百万年以前，而是不久前创造的，保尔对此深信不疑。

圣经这门课，神甫总是给保尔打满分。新约、旧约和所有的祈祷词，他都背得滚瓜烂熟。上帝哪一天创造了什么，他也都记得一清二楚。保尔打定主意，要向瓦西里神甫问个明白。等到上圣经课的时候，神甫刚坐到椅子上，保尔就举起手来，得到允许以后，他站起来说：“神甫，为什么高年级老师说，地球已经存在好几百万年了，并不像圣经上说的五千……”

他刚说到这里，就被瓦西里神甫的尖叫声打断了：“混帐东西，你胡说什么？圣经课你是怎么学的？”

保尔还没有来得及分辩，神甫就揪住他的两只耳朵，把他的头往墙上撞。一分钟之后，保尔已经鼻青脸肿，吓得半死，被神甫推到走廊上去了。

保尔回到家里，又挨了母亲好一顿责骂。

第二天，母亲到学校去恳求瓦西里神甫开恩，让她儿子回班学习。从那时起，保尔恨透了神甫。他又恨又怕。他不容许任何人对他稍加侮辱，当然也不会忘掉神甫那顿无端的毒打。他把仇恨埋在心底，不露声色。

保尔以后又受到瓦西里神甫多次小的侮辱：往往为了鸡毛蒜皮的小事，把他赶出教室，一连几个星期，天天罚他站墙角，而且从来不问他功课。因此，他不得不在复活节前，和几个不及格的同学一起，到神甫家里去补考。就在神甫家的厨房里，他把一把烟末撒到过复活节用的发面里了。

这件事谁也没有看到，可是神甫马上就猜出了是谁干的。

……下课了，孩子们一齐拥到院子里，围住了保尔。他愁眉苦脸地坐在那里，一声不响。谢廖沙在教室里没有出来，他觉得自己也有过错，但是又想不出办法帮助他的伙伴。

校长叶夫列姆·瓦西里耶维奇的脑袋从教员室的窗口探了出来，他那低沉的声音吓得保尔一哆嗦。

“叫柯察金马上到我这儿来！”他喊道。

保尔朝教员室走去，心怦怦直跳。

车站食堂的老板是个上了年纪的人，面色苍白，两眼无神。他朝站在一旁的保尔瞥了一眼。

“他几岁了？”

“十二岁。”保尔的母亲回答。

“行啊，让他留下吧。工钱每月八个卢布，当班的时候管饭。顶班干一天一宿，在家歇一天一宿，可不准偷东西。”

“哪儿能呢，哪儿能呢，我担保他什么也不偷。”母亲惶恐地说。

“那让他今天就上工吧。”老板吩咐着，转过身去，对旁边一个站柜台的女招待说：“济娜，把这个小伙计领到洗刷间去，叫弗罗霞给他派活，顶格里什卡。”

女招待正在切火腿，她放下刀，朝保尔点了点头，就穿过餐室，朝通向洗刷间的旁门走去。保尔跟在她后面。母亲也赶紧跟上，小声嘱咐保尔：“保夫鲁沙，你可要好好干哪，别丢脸！”

她用忧郁的目光把儿子送走以后，才朝大门口走去。

洗刷间里正忙得不可开交。桌子上盘碟刀叉堆得像座小山，几个女工肩头搭着毛巾，在逐个地擦那堆东西。

一个长着乱蓬蓬的红头发的男孩，年纪比保尔稍大一点，在两个大茶炉跟前忙碌着。

洗家什的大木盆里盛着开水，满屋子雾气腾腾的。保尔刚进来，连女工们的脸都看不清。他站在那里，不知道该干什么，甚至不知道站在哪里好。

女招待济娜走到一个正在洗家什的女工跟前，扳着她的肩膀，说：“弗罗霞，这个新来的小伙计是派给你的，顶格里什卡。你给他讲讲都要干些什么活吧。”

济娜又指着那个叫弗罗霞的女工，对保尔说：“她是这儿的领班，她叫你干什么，你就干什么。”说完，转身回餐室去了。

“嗯。”保尔轻轻答应了一声，同时看了看站在面前的弗罗霞，等她发话。弗罗霞一面擦着额上的汗水，一面从上到下打量着他，好像要估量一下他能干什么活似的，然后挽起从胳膊肘上滑下来的一只袖子，用非常悦耳的、响亮的声音说：“小朋友，你的活不难，就是一清早把这口锅烧开，一天别断了开水。当然，柴也要你自己劈。还有这两个大茶炉，也是你的活。再有，活紧的时候，你也得擦擦刀叉，倒倒脏水。

小朋友，活不少，够你出几身汗的。”她说的是科斯特罗马方言，总是把“ａ”音发得很重。保尔听到这一口乡音，看到她那红扑扑的脸和翘起的小鼻子，不禁有点高兴起来。

“看样子这位大婶还不错。”他心里这样想，便鼓起勇气问弗罗霞：“那我现在干些什么呢，大婶？”

他说到这里，洗刷间的女工们一阵哈哈大笑，淹没了他的话，他愣住了。

“哈哈哈！……弗罗霞这回捡了个大侄子……”

“哈哈！……”弗罗霞本人笑得比谁都厉害。

因为屋里全是蒸汽，保尔没有看清弗罗霞的脸，其实她只有十八岁。

保尔感到很难为情，便转身同那个男孩：“我现在该干什么呢？”

男孩只是嬉皮笑脸地回答：“还是问你大婶去吧，她会统统告诉你的，我在这儿是临时帮忙。”说完，转身朝厨房跑去。

这时保尔听见一个上了年纪的女工说：“过来帮着擦叉子吧。你们笑什么？这孩子说什么好笑的啦？给，拿着，”她递给保尔一条毛巾。“一头用牙咬住，一头用手拉紧。再把叉齿在上头来回蹭，要蹭得干干净净，一点脏东西也没有才成。咱们这儿对这种事挺认真。那些老爷们很挑剔，总是翻过来覆过去，看了又看，只要叉子上有一点脏东西，咱们可就倒霉了，老板娘马上会把你撵出去。”

“什么老板娘？”保尔不解地问，“雇我的老板不是男的吗？”

那个女工笑了起来：“孩子，我们这儿的老板是摆设，他是个草包。什么都是他老婆说了算。她今天不在，你干几天就知道了。”

洗刷间的门打开了，三个堂倌，每人捧着一大摞脏家什，走了进来。

其中有个宽肩膀、斜眼、四方大脸的堂倌说：“加紧点干哪，十二点的车眼看就要到了，你们还这么磨磨蹭蹭的。”

他看见了保尔，就问：“这是谁？”

“新来的。”弗罗霞回答。

“哦，新来的。”他说。“那好吧，”他一只手使劲按住保尔的肩膀，把他推到两个大茶炉跟前，说：“这两个大茶炉你得烧好，什么时候要水都得有，可是你看，现在一个已经灭了，另一个也快没火星了。今天饶了你，要是明天再这样，就叫你吃耳刮子，明白吗？”

保尔一句话也没有说，便烧起茶炉来。

保尔的劳动生涯就这样开始了。他是第一天上工，干活还从来没有这样卖过力气。他知道，这个地方跟家里不一样，在家里可以不听母亲的话，这里可不行。斜眼说得明白，要是不听话，就得吃耳刮子。

保尔脱下一只靴子，套在炉筒上，鼓起风来，能盛四桶水的大肚子茶炉立即冒出了火星。他一会儿提起脏水桶，飞快跑到外面，把脏水倒进坑里；一会儿给烧水锅添上劈柴，一会儿把湿毛巾搭在烧开的茶炉上烘干。总之，叫他干的活他都干了。直到深夜，保尔才拖着疲乏的身子，走到下面厨房去。有个上了年纪的女工，名叫阿尼西娅的，望着他刚掩上的门，说：“瞧，这孩子像个疯子似的，干起活来不要命。一定是家里实在没办法，才打发来的。”

“是啊，挺好个小伙子，”弗罗霞说。“干起活来不用催。”

“过两天跑累了，就不这么干了，”卢莎反驳说。“一开头都很卖劲……”

保尔手脚不停地忙了一个通宵，累得筋疲力尽。早晨七点钟，一个长着胖圆脸、两只小眼睛显得流里流气的男孩来接班，保尔把两个烧开的茶炉交给了他。

这个男孩一看，什么都已经弄妥了，茶炉也烧开了，便把两手往口袋里一插，从咬紧的牙缝里挤出一口唾沫，摆出一副不可一世的架势，斜着白不呲咧的眼睛看了看保尔，然后用一种不容争辩的腔调说：“喂，你这个饭桶，明天早上准六点来接班。”

“干吗六点？”保尔问。“不是七点换班吗？”

“谁乐意七点，谁就七点好了，你得六点来。要是再罗嗦，我立马叫你脑瓜上长个大疙疸。你这小子也不寻思寻思，才来就摆臭架子。”

那些刚交了班的女工都挺有兴趣地听着两个孩子的对话。那个男孩的无赖腔调和挑衅态度激怒了保尔。他朝男孩逼近一步，本来想狠狠揍他一顿，但是又怕头一天上工就给开除，才忍住了。他铁青着脸说：“你老实点，别吓唬人，搬起石头砸自己脚。明天我就七点来，要说打架，我可不在乎你，你想试试，那就请吧！”

对手朝开水锅倒退了一步，吃惊地瞧着怒气冲冲的保尔。

他没有料到会碰这么大的钉子，有点不知所措了。

“好，咱们走着瞧吧。”他含含糊糊地说。

头一天总算平安无事地过去了。保尔走在回家的路上，感到自己已经是一个用诚实的劳动挣得了休息的人。现在他也工作了，谁也不能再说他吃闲饭了。

早晨的太阳从锯木厂高大的厂房后面懒洋洋地升起来。

保尔家的小房子很快就要到了。瞧，就在眼前了，列辛斯基庄园的后身就是。

“妈大概起来了，我呢，才下工回家。”保尔想到这里，一边吹着口哨，一边加快了脚步。“学校把我赶出来，倒也不坏，反正那个该死的神甫不会让你安生，现在我真想吐他一脸唾沫。”保尔这样思量着，已经到了家门口。他推开小院门的时候，又想起来：“对，还有那个黄毛小子，一定得对准他的狗脸狠揍一顿。要不是怕给撵出来，我恨不得立时就揍他。早晚要叫他尝尝我拳头的厉害。”

母亲正在院子里忙着烧茶炊，一看见儿子回来，就慌忙问他：“怎么样？”

“挺好。”保尔回答。

母亲好像有什么事要关照他一下，可是他已经明白了。从敞开的窗户里，他看到了阿尔焦姆哥哥宽大的后背。

“怎么，阿尔焦姆回来了？”他忐忑不安地问。

“昨天回来的，这回留在家里不走了，就在机车库干活。”

保尔迟疑不决地打开了房门。

身材魁梧的阿尔焦姆坐在桌子旁边，背朝着保尔。他扭过头来，看着弟弟，又黑又浓的眉毛下面射出两道严厉的目光。

“啊，撒烟末的英雄回来了？好，你可真行！”

保尔预感到，哥哥回家后的这场谈话，对他准没个好。

“阿尔焦姆已经都知道了。”保尔心里想。“这回说不定要挨骂，也许要挨一顿揍。”

保尔有点怕阿尔焦姆。

但是，阿尔焦姆并没有打他的意思。他坐在凳子上，两只胳膊支着桌子，目不转睛地望着保尔，说不清是嘲弄还是蔑视。

“这么说，你已经大学毕业，各门学问都学到手了，现在倒起脏水来了？”阿尔焦姆说。

保尔两眼盯着一块破地板，专心地琢磨着一个冒出来的钉子头。可是阿尔焦姆却从桌旁站起来，到厨房去了。

“看样子不会挨揍了。”保尔松了一口气。

喝茶的时候，阿尔焦姆平心静气地详细询问了保尔班上发生的事情。

保尔一五一十地讲了一遍。

“你现在就这样胡闹，往后怎么得了啊。”母亲伤心地说。

“唉，可拿他怎么办呢？他这个样子究竟像谁呢？我的上帝，这孩子多叫我操心哪！”母亲诉苦说。

阿尔焦姆推开空茶杯，对保尔说：“好吧，弟弟。过去的事就算了，往后你可得小心，干活别耍花招，该干的都干好；要是再从那儿给撵出来，我就要你的好看，叫你脱一层皮。这点你要记住。妈已经够操心的了。你这个鬼东西，到哪儿都惹事，到哪儿都得闯点祸。现在该闹够了吧。等你干上一年，我再求人让你到机车库去当学徒，老是给人倒脏水，能有什么出息？还是得学一门手艺。现在你年纪还小，再过一年我求求人看，机车库也许能收你。我已经转到这儿来了，往后就在这儿干活。妈再也不去伺候人了。见到什么样的混蛋都弯腰，也弯够了。可是保尔，你自己得争气，要好好做人。”

他站起来，挺直高大的身躯，把搭在椅背上的上衣穿上，然后关照母亲说：“我出去个把钟头，办点事。”说完，一弯腰，跨出了房门。他走到院子里，从窗前经过的时候，又说：“我给你带来一双靴子和一把小刀，妈会拿给你的。”

车站食堂昼夜不停地营业。

有六条铁路通到这个枢纽站。车站总是挤满了人，只有夜里，在两班火车的间隙，才能安静两三个钟头。这个车站上有几百列军车从各地开来，然后又开到各地去。有的从前线开来，有的开到前线去。从前线运来的是缺胳膊断腿的伤兵，送到前线去的是大批穿一色灰大衣的新兵。

保尔在食堂里辛辛苦苦地干了两年。这两年里，他看到的只有厨房和洗刷间。在地下室的大厨房里，工作异常繁忙，干活的有二十多个人。十个堂倌从餐室到厨房穿梭般地来回奔忙着。

保尔的工钱从八个卢布长到十个卢布。两年来他长高了，身体也结实了。这期间，他经受了许多苦难。在厨房打下手，烟熏火燎地干了半年。那个有权势的厨子头不喜欢这个犟孩子，常常给他几个耳光。他生怕保尔突然捅他一刀，所以干脆把他撵回了洗刷间。要不是因为保尔干起活来有用不完的力气，他们早就把他赶走了。保尔干的活比谁都多，从来不知道疲劳。

在食堂最忙的时候，他脚不沾地地跑来跑去，一会儿端着托盘，一步跨四五级楼梯，下到厨房去，一会儿又从厨房跑上来。

每天夜里，当食堂的两个餐室消停下来的时候，堂倌们就聚在下面厨房的储藏室里大赌特赌，打起“二十一点”和“九点”来。保尔不止一次看见赌台上堆着一沓沓钞票。他们有这么多钱，保尔并不感到惊讶。他知道，他们每个人当一天一宿班，能捞到三四十个卢布的外快，收一次小费就是一个卢布、半个卢布的。有了钱就大喝大赌。保尔非常憎恶他们。

“这帮该死的混蛋！”他心里想。“像阿尔焦姆这样的头等钳工，一个月才挣四十八个卢布，我才挣十个卢布；可是他们一天一宿就捞这么多钱，凭什么？也就是把菜端上去，把空盘子撤下来。有了钱就喝尽赌光。”

保尔认为，他们跟那些老板是一路货，都是他的冤家对头。“这帮下流坯，别看他们在这儿低三下四地伺候人，他们的老婆孩子在城里却像有钱人一样摆阔气。”

他们常常把穿着中学生制服的儿子带来，有时也把养得滚圆的老婆领来。“他们的钱大概比他们伺候的老爷还要多。”

保尔这样想。他对夜间在厨房的角落里和食堂的仓库里发生的事情也不大惊小怪。保尔清楚地知道，任何一个洗家什女工和女招待，要是不肯以几个卢布的代价把自己的肉体出卖给食堂里每个有权有势的人，她们在这里是干不长远的。

保尔向生活的深处，向生活的底层看去，他追求一切新事物，渴望打开一个新天地，可是朝他扑面而来的，却是霉烂的臭味和泥沼的潮气。

阿尔焦姆想把弟弟安置到机车库去当学徒，但是没有成功，因为那里不收未满十五岁的少年。保尔期待着有朝一日能摆脱这个地方，机车库那座熏黑了的大石头房子吸引着他。

他时常到阿尔焦姆那里去，跟着他检查车辆，尽力帮他干点活。

弗罗霞离开食堂以后，保尔就更加感到烦闷了。

这个爱笑的、快乐的姑娘已经不在这里了，保尔这才更深地体会到，他们之间的友谊是多么深厚。现在呢，早晨一走进洗刷间，听到从难民中招来的女工们的争吵叫骂，他就会产生一种空虚和孤独的感觉。

夜间休息的时候，保尔蹲在打开的炉门前，往炉膛里添劈柴；他眯起眼睛，瞧着炉膛里的火。炉火烤得他暖烘烘的，挺舒服。洗刷间就剩他一个人了。

他的思绪不知不觉地回到不久以前发生的事情上来，他想起了弗罗霞。那时的情景又清晰地浮现在眼前。

那是一个星期六。夜间休息的时候，保尔顺着楼梯下厨房去。在转弯的地方，他好奇地爬上柴堆，想看一看储藏室，因为人们通常聚在那里赌钱。

那里赌得正起劲，扎利瓦诺夫坐庄，他兴奋得满脸通红。

楼梯上传来了脚步声。保尔回过头，看见堂倌普罗霍尔从上边走下来。保尔连忙躲到楼梯下面，等他走过去。楼梯下面黑洞洞的，普罗霍尔看不见他。

普罗霍尔转了个弯，朝下面走去，保尔看见了他的宽肩膀和大脑袋。

正在这时候，又有人从上面轻轻地快步跑下来，保尔听到了一个熟悉的声音：“普罗霍尔，你等一下。”

普罗霍尔站住了，掉头朝上面看了一眼。

“什么事？”他咕哝了一句。

有人顺着楼梯走了下来，保尔认出是弗罗霞。

她拉住堂倌的袖子，压低声音，结结巴巴地说：“普罗霍尔，中尉给你的钱呢？”

普罗霍尔猛然挣脱胳膊，恶狠狠地说：“什么？钱？难道我没给你吗？”

“可是人家给你的是三百个卢布啊。”弗罗霞抑制不住自己，几乎要放声大哭了。

“你说什么，三百个卢布？”普罗霍尔挖苦她说。“怎么，你想都要？好小姐，一个洗家什的女人，值那么多钱吗？照我看，给你五十个卢布就不少了。你想想，你有多走运吧！就是那些年轻太太，比你干净得多，又有文化，还拿不到这么多钱呢。陪着睡一夜，就挣五十个卢布，你得谢天谢地。哪儿有那么多傻瓜。行了，我再给你添一二十个卢布就算了事。只要你放聪明点，往后挣钱的机会有的是，我给你拉主顾。”

普罗霍尔说完最后一句话，转身到厨房去了。

“你这个流氓，坏蛋！”弗罗霞追着他骂了两句，接着便靠在柴堆上呜呜地哭起来。

保尔站在楼梯下面的暗处，听了这场谈话，又看到弗罗霞浑身颤抖，把头往柴堆上撞，他心头的滋味真是不可名状。

保尔没有露面，没有做声，只是猛然一把死死抓住楼梯的铁栏杆，脑子里轰的一声掠过一个清晰而明确的想法：“连她也给出卖了，这帮该死的家伙。唉，弗罗霞，弗罗霞……”

保尔心里对普罗霍尔的仇恨更深更强了，他憎恶和仇视周围的一切。“唉，我要是个大力士，一定揍死这个无赖！我怎么不像阿尔焦姆那样大、那样壮呢？”

炉膛里的火时起时落，火苗抖动着，聚在一起，卷成了一条长长的蓝色火舌；保尔觉得，好像有一个人在讥笑他，嘲弄他，朝他吐舌头。

屋子里静悄悄的，只有炉子里不时发出的哔剥声和水龙头均匀的滴水声。

克利姆卡把最后一只擦得锃亮的平底锅放到架子上之后，擦着手。厨房里已经没有别人了。值班的厨师和打下手的女工们都在更衣室里睡了。夜里，厨房可以安静三个小时。

这个时候，克利姆卡总是跑上来跟保尔一起消磨时间。厨房里的这个小徒弟跟黑眼睛的小烧水工很要好。克利姆卡一上来，就看见保尔蹲在打开的炉门前面。保尔也在墙上看到了那个熟悉的头发蓬松的人影，他头也不回地说：“坐下吧，克利姆卡。”

厨房的小徒弟爬上劈柴堆，躺了下来。他看了看坐在那里闷声不响的保尔，笑着说：“你怎么啦？对火作法吗？”

保尔好不容易才把目光从火苗上移开。现在这一对闪亮的大眼睛直勾勾地望着克利姆卡。克利姆卡从他的眼神里看见了一种无言的悲哀。他还是第一次看到伙伴这种忧郁的神情。

“保尔，今天你有点古怪……”他沉默了一会儿，又问保尔：“你碰到什么事了？”

保尔站起来，坐到克利姆卡身旁。

“没什么，”他闷声闷气地回答。“我在这儿呆着很不痛快。”他把放在膝上的两只手攥成了拳头。

“你今天是怎么了？”克利姆卡用胳膊支起身子，接着问。

“你问我今天怎么了？我从到这儿来干活的那天起，就一直不怎么的。你看看，这儿是个什么地方！咱们像骆驼一样干活，可得到的报答呢，是谁高兴谁就赏你几个嘴巴子，连一个护着你的人都没有。老板雇咱们，是要咱们给他干活，可是随便哪一个都有权揍你，只要他有劲。就算你有分身法，也不能一下子把人人都伺候到。一个伺候不到，就得挨揍。你就是拼命干，该做的都做得好好的，谁也挑不出毛病，你就是哪儿叫哪儿到，忙得脚打后脑勺，也总有伺候不到的时候，那又是一顿耳刮子……”

克利姆卡吃了一惊，赶紧打断他的话头：“你别这么大声嚷嚷，说不定有人过来，会听见的。”

保尔抽身站了起来。

“听见就听见，反正我是要离开这儿的。到铁路上扫雪也比在这儿强，这儿是什么地方……是地狱，这帮家伙除了骗子还是骗子。他们都有的是钱，咱们在他们眼里不过是畜生。对姑娘们，他们想怎么干就怎么干。要是哪个长得漂亮一点，又不肯服服帖帖，马上就会给赶出去。她们能躲到哪儿去？她们都是些难民，吃没吃的，住没住的。她们总得填饱肚子，这儿好歹有口饭吃。为了不挨饿，只好任人家摆布。”

保尔讲起这些事情，是那样愤愤不平，克利姆卡真担心别人会听到他们的谈话，急忙站起来把通向厨房的门关好，可是保尔还是只管倾吐他那满腔的积愤。

“拿你来说吧，克利姆卡，人家打你，你总是不吭声。你为什么不吭声呢？”

保尔坐到桌旁的凳子上，疲倦地用手托着头。克利姆卡往炉子里添了些劈柴，也在桌旁坐下。

“今天咱们还读不读书啦？”他问保尔。

“没书读了，”保尔回答。“书亭没开门。”

“怎么，难道书亭今天休息？”克利姆卡惊讶地问。

“卖书的给宪兵抓走了，还搜走了一些什么东西。”保尔回答。

“为什么抓他？”

“听说是因为搞政治。”

克利姆卡莫名其妙地瞧了保尔一眼。

“政治是什么呀？”

保尔耸了耸肩膀，说：“鬼才知道！听说，谁要是反对沙皇，这就叫政治。”

克利姆卡吓得打了个冷战。

“难道还有这样的人？”

“不知道。”保尔回答。

洗刷间的门开了，睡眼惺忪的格拉莎走了进来。

“你们怎么不睡觉呢，孩子们？趁火车没来，还可以睡上一个钟头。去睡吧，保尔，我替你看一会儿水锅。”

保尔没有想到，他这样快就离开了食堂，离开的原因也完全出乎他的意外。

这是一月的一个严寒的日子，保尔干完自己的一班，准备回家了，但是接班的人没有来。保尔到老板娘那里去，说他要回家，老板娘却不放他走。他虽然已经很累，还是不得不留下来，连班再干一天一宿。到了夜里，他已经筋疲力尽了。大家都休息的时候，他还要把几口锅灌满水，赶在三点钟的火车进站以前烧开。

保尔拧开水龙头，可是没有水，看来是水塔没有放水。他让水龙头开着，自己倒在柴堆上歇一会儿，不想实在支持不住，一下就睡着了。

过了几分钟，水龙头咕嘟咕嘟地响了起来，水流进水槽，不一会儿就漫了出来，顺着瓷砖滴到洗刷间的地板上。洗刷间里跟往常一样，一个人也没有。水越来越多，漫过地板，从门底下流进了餐室。

一股股水流悄悄地流到熟睡的旅客们的行李下面，谁也没有发觉。直到水浸醒了一个躺在地板上的旅客，他一下跳起来，大喊大叫，其他旅客才慌忙去抢自己的行李。食堂里顿时乱作一团。

水还是流个不停，越流越多。

正在另一个餐室里收拾桌子的普罗霍尔听到旅客的喊叫声，急忙跑过来。他跳过积水，冲到门旁，用力把门打开，原来被门挡住的水一下子全涌进了餐室。

喊叫声更大了。几个当班的堂倌一齐跑进了洗刷间。普罗霍尔径直朝酣睡的保尔扑过去。

拳头像雨点一样落在保尔头上。他简直疼糊涂了。

保尔刚被打醒，什么也不明白。眼睛里直冒金星，浑身火辣辣地疼。

他周身是伤，一步一步地勉强挪到了家。

早晨，阿尔焦姆阴沉着脸，皱着眉头，叫保尔把事情的经过告诉他。

保尔从头到尾讲了一遍。

“谁打的？”阿尔焦姆瓮声瓮气地问弟弟。

“普罗霍尔。”

“好，你躺着吧。”

Part One Chapter 2
---

Like a whirlwind the stupendous news broke into the small town: "The tsar's been overthrown!"

The townsfolk refused to believe it.

Then one stormy winter day a train crawled into the station: two students in army greatcoats, with rifles slung over their shoulders, and a detachment of revolutionary soldiers wearing red armbands jumped out onto the platform and arrested the station gendarmes, an old colonel and the chief of the garrison. Now the townsfolk believed the news. Thousands streamed down the snowbound streets to the town square.

Eagerly they drank in the new words: liberty, equality and fraternity.

Turbulent days followed, days full of excitement and jubilation. Then a lull set in, and the red flag flying over the town hall where the Mensheviks and adherents of the Bund had ensconced themselves was the sole reminder of the change that had taken place. Everything else remained as before.

Towards the end of the winter a regiment of the cavalry guards was billeted in the town. In the mornings they sallied out in squadrons to hunt for deserters from the South-Western Front at the railway station.

The troopers were great, beefy fellows with well-fed faces. Most of their officers were counts and princes; they wore golden shoulder straps and silver piping on their breeches, just as they had in the tsar's time—for all the world as if there had been no revolution.

For Pavel, Klimka and Sergei Bruzzhak nothing had changed. The bosses were still there. It was not until November that something out of the ordinary began to happen. People of a new kind had appeared at the station and were beginning to stir things up; a steadily increasing number of them were soldiers from the firing lines and they bore the strange name of "Bolsheviks".

Where that resounding, weighty name came from no one knew.

The guardsmen found it increasingly hard to detain the deserters. The crackle of rifles and the splintering of glass was heard more and more often down at the station. The men came from the front in groups and when stopped they fought back with bayonets. In the beginning of December they began pouring in by trainloads. 

The guardsmen came down in force to the station with the intention of holding the soldiers, but they found themselves raked by machine-gun fire. The men who poured out of the railway carriages were inured to death. 

The grey-coated frontliners drove the guards back into the town and then returned to the station to continue on their way, trainload after trainload.

One day in the spring of nineteen eighteen, three chums on their way from Sergei Bruzzhak's where they had been playing cards dropped into the Korchagins' garden and threw themselves on the grass. They were bored. All the customary occupations had begun to pall, and they were beginning to rack their brains for some more exciting way to spend the day when they heard the clatter of horses' hoofs behind them and saw a horseman come galloping down the road. With one bound the horse cleared the ditch between the road and the low garden fence and the rider waved his whip at Pavel and Klim. "Hi there, my lads, come over here!" Pavel and Klim sprang to their feet and ran to the fence. The rider was covered with dust; it had settled in a heavy grey Layer on the cap which he wore pushed to the back of his head, and on his khaki tunic and breeches. A revolver and two German grenades dangled from his heavy soldier's belt. 

"Can you get me a drink of water, boys?" the horseman asked them. While Pavel dashed off into the house for the water, he turned to Sergei who was staring at him. "Tell me, boy, who's in authority in your town?" 

Sergei breathlessly related all the local news to the newcomer. 

"There's been nobody in authority for two weeks. The homeguard's the government now. All the inhabitants take turns patrolling the town at night. And who might you be?" Sergei asked in his turn. 

"Now, now—if you know too much you'll get old too soon," the horseman smiled. 

Pavel ran out of the house carrying a mug of water. The rider thirstily emptied the mug at one gulp and handed it back to Pavel. Then jerking the reins he started off at a gallop, heading for the pine woods. "Who was that?" Pavel asked Klim. "How do I know?" the latter replied, shrugging his shoulders. 

"Looks like the authorities are going to be changed again. That's why the Leszczinskis left yesterday. And if the rich are on the run that means the partisans are coming," declared Sergei, settling the political question firmly and with an air of finality. 

The logic of this was so convincing that both Pavel and Klim agreed with him at once. 

Before the boys had finished discussing the question a clatter of hoofs from the highway sent all three rushing back to the fence. 

Over by the forest warden's cottage, which was barely visible among the trees, they saw men and carts emerging from the woods, and nearer still on the highway a party of fifteen or so mounted men with rifles across their pommels. At the head of the horsemen rode an elderly man in khaki jacket and officer's belt with field glasses slung on his chest, and beside him the man the boys had just spoken to. The elderly man wore a red ribbon on his breast. 

"What did I tell you?" Sergei nudged Pavel in the ribs. "See the red ribbon? Partisans. I'll be damned if they aren't partisans. . . ." And whooping with joy he leapt over the fence into the street. 

The others followed suit and all three stood by the roadside gazing at the approaching horsemen. 

When the riders were quite close the man whom the boys had met before nodded to them, and pointing to the Leszczinski house with his whip asked: 

"Who lives over there?" 

Pavel paced alongside trying to keep abreast the rider. 

"Leszczinski the lawyer. He ran away yesterday. Scared of you most likely. . . ." 

"How do you know who we are?" the elderly man asked, smiling. 

"What about that?" Pavel pointed to the ribbon. "Anybody can tell. . . ." 

People poured into the street to stare with curiosity at the detachment entering the town. Our three young friends too stood watching the dusty, exhausted Red Guards go by. And when the detachment's lone cannon and the carts with machine guns clattered over the cobblestones the boys trailed after the partisans, and did not go home until after the unit had halted in the centre of the town and the billeting began. 

That evening four men sat around the massive carved-legged table in the spacious Leszczinski parlour: detachment commander Comrade Bulgakov, an elderly man whose hair was touched with grey, and three members of the unit's commanding personnel. 

Bulgakov had spread out a map of the gubernia on the table and was now running his finger over it. 

"You say we ought to put up a stand here, Comrade Yermachenko," he said, addressing a man with broad features and prominent teeth, "but I think we must move out in the morning. Better still if we could get going during the night, but the men are in need of a rest. Our task is to withdraw to Kazatin before the Germans get there. To resist with the strength we have would be ridiculous. 

One gun with thirty rounds of ammunition, two hundred infantry and sixty cavalry. A formidable force, isn't it, when the Germans are advancing in an avalanche of steel. We cannot put up a fight until we join up with other withdrawing Red units. Besides, Comrades, we must remember that apart from the Germans there'll be numerous counter-revolutionary bands of all kinds to deal with en route. I propose that we withdraw in the morning after first blowing up the railway bridge beyond the station. It'll take the Germans two or three days to repair it and in the meantime their advance along the railway will be held up. What do you think, Comrades? We must decide. . ." he turned to the others around the table. 

Struzhkov, who sat diagonally across from Bulgakov, sucked in his lips and looked first at the map and then at Bulgakov. 

"I agree with Bulgakov," he said finally. 

The youngest of the men, who was dressed in a worker's blouse, nodded. 

"Bulgakov's right," he said. 

But Yermachenko, the man who had spoken with the boys earlier in the day, shook his head. 

"What the devil did we get the detachment together for? To retreat from the Germans without putting up a fight? As I see it, we've got to have it out with them here. I'm sick and tired of running. If it was up to me, I'd fight them here without fail. . . ." Pushing his chair back sharply, he rose and began pacing the room. 

Bulgakov looked at him with disapproval. 

"We must use our heads, Yermachenko. We can't throw our men into a battle that is bound to end in defeat and destruction Besides it's ridiculous. There's a whole division with heavy artillery and armoured cars just behind us. . . . This is no time for schoolboy heroics, Comrade Yermachenko. . . ." Turning to the others, he continued: "So it's decided, we evacuate tomorrow morning. . . . Now for the next question, liaison," Bulgakov proceeded. "Since we are the last to leave, it's our job to organise work in the German rear. This is a big railway junction and there are two stations in the town. We must see to it that there is a reliable comrade to carry on the work on the railway. We'll have to decide here whom to leave behind to get the work going. Have you anyone in mind?" 

"I think the sailor Fyodor Zhukhrai ought to remain," Yermachenko said, moving up to the table. 

"In the first place he's a local man. Secondly, he's a fitter and mechanic and can get himself a job at the station. Nobody's seen Fyodor with our etachment—he won't get here until tonight. He's got a good head on his shoulders and he'll get things going properly. I think he's the best man for the job." 

Bulgakov nodded. 

"I agree with you, Yermachenko. No objections, Comrades?" he turned to the others. "None. Then the matter is settled. We'll leave Zhukhrai some money and the credentials he'll need for his work. . . . Now for the third and last question, Comrades. About the arms stored here in the town. 

There's quite a stock of rifles, twenty thousand of them, left over from the tsarist war and forgotten by everybody. They are piled up in a peasant's shed. I have this from the owner of the shed who happens to be anxious to get rid of them. We are not going to leave them to the Germans; in my opinion we ought to burn them, and at once, so as to have it over and done with by morning. The only trouble is that the fire might spread to the surrounding cottages. It's on the fringes of the town where the poor peasants live." 

Struzhkov stirred in his chair. He was a solidly built man whose unshaven face had not seen a razor for some time. 

"Why burn the rifles? Better distribute them among the population." 

Bulgakov turned quickly to face him. 

"Distribute them, you say?" 

"A splendid idea!" Yermachenko responded enthusiastically. "Give them to the workers and anyone else who wants them. At least there will be something to hit back with when the Germans make life impossible. They're bound to do their worst. And when things come to a head, the men will be able to take up arms. Struzhkov's right: the rifles must be distributed. Wouldn't be a bad thing to take some to the villages too; the peasants will hide them away, and when the Germans begin to requisition everything the rifles are sure to come in handy." 

Bulgakov laughed. 

"That's all right, but the Germans are sure to order all arms turned in and everybody will obey." 

"Not everybody," Yermachenko objected. "Some will but others won't." 

Bulgakov looked questioningly at the men around the table. 

"I'm for distributing the rifles," the young workers supported Yermachenko and Struzhkov. 

"All right then, it's decided," Bulgakov agreed. "That's all for now," he said, rising from his chair. 

"We can take a rest till morning. When Zhukhrai comes, send him in to me, I want to have a talk with him. Yermachenko, you'd better inspect the sentry posts." 

When the others left, Bulgakov went into the bedroom next to the parlour, spread his greatcoat on the mattress and lay down.

The following morning Pavel, coming home from the electric power station where he had been working as a stoker's helper for a year now, felt that something unusual was afoot. The town seethed with excitement. As he went along he met people carrying one or two and sometimes even three rifles each. He could not understand what was happening and he hurried home as fast as he could. Outside the Leszczinski garden he saw his acquaintances of yesterday mounting their horses.

Pavel ran into the house, washed quickly and, learning from his mother that Artem had not come home yet, dashed out again and hurried over to see Sergei Bruzzhak, who lived on the other side of the town.

Sergei's father was an engine driver's helper and owned a tiny house and a small plot of land.

Sergei was out, and his mother, a stout, pale-faced woman, eyed Pavel sourly.

"The devil knows where he is! He rushed out first thing in the morning like one possessed. Said they were giving out rifles somewhere, so I suppose that's where he is. What you snotnosed warriors need is a good hiding—you've got out of hand completely. Hardly out of pinafores and already dashing off after firearms. You tell the scamp that if he brings a single cartridge into this house I'll skin him alive. Who knows what he'll be dragging in and then I'll have to answer for it.

You're not going there too, are you?"

But before Sergei's mother had finished scolding, Pavel was already racing down the street.

On the highway he met a man carrying a rifle on each shoulder. Pavel dashed up to him.

"Please, uncle, where did you get them?"

"Over at Verkhovina."

Pavel hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him. Two streets down he collided with a boy who was lugging a heavy infantry rifle with bayonet attached. Pavel stopped him.

"Where'd you get that?"

"The partisans were giving them away out there opposite the school, but there aren't any more. All gone. Handed them out all night and now only the empty cases are left. This is my second one,"

the boy declared proudly.

Pavel was utterly dismayed by the news.

"Damn it, I should've gone straight there," he thought bitterly. "Now it's too late!"

Suddenly an idea struck him. Spinning around, he overtook the boy in two or three bounds and snatched the rifle out of his hands.

"One's enough for you. This is going to be mine," he said in a tone that brooked no opposition.

Infuriated by this robbery in broad daylight, the boy flung himself at Pavel, but the latter leapt back and pointed the bayonet at his antagonist.

"Look out or you'll get hurt!" Pavel shouted.

The boy burst into tears of helpless rage and ran away, swearing at Pavel as he went. Pavel, vastly pleased with himself, trotted home. He climbed over the fence, ran into the shed, laid his acquisition on the crossbeams under the roof, and, whistling gaily, entered the house.

Summer evenings in the Ukraine, especially in small Ukrainian towns like Shepetovka, which are more like villages on the outskirts, are beautiful indeed. These calm summer nights lure all the young folk out of doors. You will see them in groups and in pairs—on the porches, in the little front gardens, or perched on woodpiles lying by the side of the road. Their gay laughter and singing echo in the evening stillness.

The air is heavy and tremulous with the fragrance of flowers. There is a faint pinpoint glimmer of stars in the depths of the sky, and voices carry far, far away. . . .

Pavel dearly loved his accordion. He would lay the melodious instrument tenderly on his knees and let his nimble fingers run lightly up and down the double row of keys. A sighing from the bass, and a cascade of rollicking melody would pour forth. . . .

How can you keep still when the sinuous bellows weave in and out and the accordion breathes its warm compelling harmonies. Before you know it your feet are answering its urgent summons. Ah,how good it is to be alive!

This is a particularly jolly evening. A merry crowd of young folk have gathered on the pile of logs outside Pavel's house. And gayest of them all is Galochka, the daughter of the stonemason who lives next door to Pavel. Galochka loves to dance and sing with the lads. She has a deep velvety

contralto.

Pavel is a wee bit afraid of her. For Galochka has a sharp tongue. She sits down beside Pavel and throws her arms around him, laughing gaily.

"What a wonder you are with that accordion!" she says. "It's a pity you're a bit too young or you'd make me a fine hubby. I adore men who play the accordion, my poor heart just melts."

Pavel blushes to the roots of his hair—luckily it is too dark for anyone to see. He edges away from the vixen but she clings fast to him.

"Now then, you wouldn't run away from me, would you? A fine sweetheart you are," she laughs.

Her firm breast brushes Pavel's shoulder, and he is strangely stirred in spite of himself, and the loud laughter of the others breaks the accustomed stillness of the lane.

"Move up, I haven't any room to play," says Pavel, giving her shoulder a slight push.

This evokes another roar of laughter, jokes and banter.

Marusya comes to Pavel's rescue. "Play something sad, Pavel, something that tugs at your heartstrings."

Slowly the bellows spread out, gently Pavel's fingers caress the keys and a familiar well-loved tune fills the air. Galochka is the first to join in, then Marusya, and the others.

All the boatmen to their cottage Gathered on the morrow,O, 'tis goodAnd O, 'tis sweetHere to sing our sorrow. . . .

The vibrant young voices of the singers were carried far away into the wooded distances.

"Pavka!" It was Artem's voice.

Pavel compressed the bellows of his accordion and fastened the straps.

"They're calling me. I've got to go."

"Oh, play just a little more. What's your hurry?" Marusya tried to wheedle him into staying.

But Pavel was adamant.

"Can't. We'll have some music tomorrow again, but now I've got to go. Artem's calling." And with that he ran across the street to the little house opposite.

There were two men in the room besides Artem: Roman, a friend of Artem's, and a stranger. They were sitting at the table.

"You wanted me?" Pavel asked.

Artem nodded to him and turned to the stranger:

"This is that brother of mine we've been talking about."

The stranger extended a knotted hand to Pavel.

"See here, Pavka," Artem said to his brother. "You told me the electrician at the power plant is ill.

Now what I want you to do is to find out tomorrow whether they want a good man to take his place. If they do you'll let us know."

The stranger interrupted him.

"No need to do that. I'd rather go with him and speak with the boss myself."

"Of course they need someone. Today the power plant didn't work simply because Stankovich was ill. The boss came around twice—he'd been looking high and low for somebody to take his place but couldn't find anyone. He was afraid to start the plant with only a stoker around. The electrician's got the typhus."

"That settles it," the stranger said. "I'll call for you tomorrow and we'll go over there together."

"Good."

Pavel's glance met the calm grey eyes of the stranger who was studying him carefully. The firm,steady scrutiny somewhat disconcerted him. The newcomer was wearing a grey jacket buttoned from top to bottom—it was obviously a tight fit for the seams strained on his broad, powerful

back. His head and shoulders were joined by a muscular, ox-like neck, and his whole frame suggested the sturdy strength of an old oak.

"Good-bye and good luck, Zhukhrai," Artem said accompanying him to the door. "Tomorrow you'll go along with my brother and get fixed up in the job."

The Germans entered the town three days after the detachment left. Their coming was announced by a locomotive whistle at the station which had latterly been deserted.

"The Germans are coming," the news flashed through the town.

The town stirred like a disturbed anthill, for although the townsfolk had known for some time that the Germans were due, they had somehow not quite believed it. And now these terrible Germans were not only somewhere on their way, but actually here, in town.

The townsfolk clung to the protection of their front-garden fences and wicket gates. They were afraid to venture out into the streets.

The Germans came, marching single file on both sides of the highway; they wore olive-drab uniforms and carried their rifles at the ready. Their rifles were tipped with broad knife-like bayonets; they wore heavy steel helmets, and carried enormous packs on their backs. They came from the station into the town in an endless stream, came cautiously, prepared to repel an attack at any moment, although no one dreamed of attacking them.

In front strode two officers, Mausers in hand, and in the centre of the road walked the interpreter, a sergeant-major in the Hetman's service wearing a blue Ukrainian coat and a tall fur cap. 

The Germans lined up on the square in the centre of the town. The drums rolled. A small crowd of the more venturesome townsfolk gathered. The Hetman's man in the Ukrainian coat climbed onto the porch of the chemist's shop and read aloud an order issued by the commandant, Major Korf.

§1

All citizens of the town are hereby ordered to turn in any firearms or other weapons in their possession within 24 hours. The penalty for violation of this order is death by shooting.

§2

Martial law is declared in the town and citizens are forbidden to appear in the streets after 8 p.m. Major Korf, Town Commandant.

The German Kommandantur took up quarters in the building formerly used by the town administration and, after the revolution, by the Soviet of Workers' Deputies. At the entrance a sentry was posted wearing a parade helmet with an imperial eagle of enormous proportions. In the backyard of the same building were storage premises for the arms to be turned in by the population. 

All day long weapons were brought in by townsfolk scared by the threat of shooting. The adults did not show themselves; the arms were delivered by youths and small boys. The Germans detained nobody. 

Those who did not want to come in person dumped their weapons out on the road during the night, and in the morning a German patrol picked them up, loaded them into an army cart and hauled them to the Kommandantur. 

At one o'clock in the afternoon, when the time limit expired, German soldiers began to take stock of their booty: fourteen thousand rifles. That meant that six thousand had not been turned in. The dragnet searches they conducted yielded very insignificant results. 

At dawn the next morning two railway men in whose homes concealed rifles had been found were shot at the old Jewish cemetery outside the town. 

As soon as he heard of the commandant's order, Artem hurried home. Meeting Pavel in the yard, he took him by the shoulder and asked him quietly but firmly: 

"Did you bring any weapons home?" 

Pavel had not intended to say anything about the rifle, but he could not lie to his brother and so he made a clean breast of it. 

They went into the shed together. Artem took the rifle down from its hiding place on the beams, removed the bolt and bayonet, and seizing the weapon by the barrel swung it with all his might against a fence post. The butt splintered. What remained of the rifle was thrown far away into the waste lot beyond the garden. The bayonet and bolt Artem threw into the privy pit. 

When he was finished, Artem turned to his brother. 

"You're not a baby any more, Pavka, and you ought to know you can't play with guns. You must not bring anything into the house. This is dead serious. You might have to pay with your life for that sort of thing nowadays. And don't try any tricks, because if you do bring something like that home and they find it I'd be the first to be shot—they wouldn't touch a youngster like you. These are brutal times, understand that!" 

Pavel promised. 

As the brothers were crossing the yard to the house, a carriage stopped at the Leszczinskis' gate and the lawyer and his wife and two children, Nelly and Victor, got out. 

"So the fine birds have flown back to their nest," Artem muttered angrily. "Now the fun begins, blast them!" He went inside. 

All day long Pavel thought regretfully of the rifle. In the meantime his friend Sergei was hard at work in an old, abandoned shed, digging a hole in the ground next to the wall. At last the pit was ready. In it Sergei deposited the three brand-new rifles, carefully wrapped in rags: he had picked 

them up when the Red Guard detachment distributed arms to the people. He had no intention of giving them up to the Germans and had laboured hard all night to make sure that they were safely hidden. 

He filled up the hole, tramped the earth down level, and then piled a heap of refuse on top. 

Critically reviewing the results of his efforts and finding them satisfactory he took off his cap and wiped the sweat off his forehead. 

"Now let them search, and even if they find it, they'll never know who put it there, because the shed is nobody's anyway." 

A firm friendship had sprung up between Pavel and the grim-faced electrician who had been working a full month now at the electric station. Zhukhrai showed the stoker's helper how the dynamo was built and how it was run. 

The sailor took a liking to the bright youngster. He frequently visited Artem on free days and listened patiently to the mother's tale of domestic woes and worries, especially when she complained about her younger boy's escapades. Thoughtful and serious, Zhukhrai had a calming, reassuring effect on Maria Yakovlevna, who would forget her troubles and grow more cheerful in his company. 

One day Zhukhrai stopped Pavel as he was passing between the high piles of firewood in the power station yard. 

"Your mother tells me you're fond of a scrap," he said, smiling. " 'He's as bad as a game-cock,' she says." Zhukhrai chuckled approvingly. "As a matter of fact, it doesn't hurt to be a fighter, as long as you know whom to fight and why." 

Pavel was not sure whether Zhukhrai was joking or serious. 

"I don't fight for nothing," he retorted, "I always fight for what's right and fair." 

"Want me to teach you to fight properly?" Zhukhrai asked unexpectedly. 

"What d'you mean, properly?" Pavel looked at the other in surprise. "You'll see." 

And Pavel was given a brief introductory lecture on boxing. 

It did not come easy to Pavel. Time and again he found himself rolling on the ground, knocked off his feet by a blow from Zhukhrai's fist, but he proved a diligent and persevering pupil, and in the end he mastered the art. 

One warm day after a visit to Klimka's place Pavel, for want of something better to do, decided to climb up to his favourite spot—the roof of a shed that stood in the corner of the garden behind the house. He crossed the backyard into the garden, went over to the clapboard shack, and climbed up onto its roof. Pushing through the dense branches of the cherry trees that hung over the shed, he made his way to the centre of the roof and lay down to bask in the sunshine. 

One side of the shed jutted out into the Leszczinski garden, and from the end of the roof the whole garden and one side of the house were visible. Poking his head over the edge, Pavel could see part of the yard and a carriage standing there. The batman of the German Lieutenant quartered at the Leszczinskis' was brushing his master's clothes. 

Pavel had often seen the Lieutenant at the gate leading to the grounds. He was a squat, ruddy-faced man who wore a tiny clipped moustache, pince-nez and a cap with a shiny lacquered peak. 

Pavel also knew that he lived in the side room, the window of which opened onto the garden and was visible from the shed roof. 

At this moment the Lieutenant was sitting at the table, writing. Presently he picked up what he had written and went out of the room. He handed the paper to the batman and walked off down the garden path leading to the gate. At the summer house he paused to talk to someone inside. A moment later Nelly Leszczinskaya came out. The Lieutenant took her arm and together they went out of the gate into the street. 

Pavel watched the proceedings from his vantage point. Presently a drowsiness stole over him and he was about to close his eyes when he noticed the batman entering the Lieutenant's room; he hung up a uniform, opened the window into the garden and tidied up the room. Then he went out, closing the door behind him. The next moment Pavel saw him over by the stable where the horses were. 

Through the open window Pavel had a good view of the whole room. On the table lay a belt and some shining object. 

Driven by an irresistible curiosity, Pavel climbed noiselessly off the roof onto the cherry tree and slipped down into the Leszczinski garden. Bent double, he bounded across the garden and peered through the window into the room. Before him on the table were a belt with a shoulder strap and holster containing a splendid twelve-shot Mannlicher. 

Pavel caught his breath. For a few seconds he hesitated, but reckless daring gained the upper hand and reaching into the room, he seized the holster, pulled out the new blue-steel weapon and sprang down to the ground. With a swift glance around, he slipped the revolver into his pocket and dashed across the garden to the cherry tree. With the agility of a monkey he climbed to the roof and paused to look behind him. The batman was still chatting pleasantly with the groom. The garden was silent and deserted. Pavel slid down the other side and ran home. 

His mother was busy in the kitchen cooking dinner and paid no attention to him. 

He seized a rag from behind a trunk and shoved it into his pocket, then slipped out unnoticed, ran across the yard, scaled the fence and emerged on the road leading to the woods. Holding the heavy revolver to prevent it from knocking against his thigh, he ran as fast as he could to the abandoned ruins of a brick kiln in the woods. 

His feet seemed barely to touch the ground and the wind whistled in his ears. 

Everything was quiet at the old brick kiln. It was a depressing sight, with the wooden roof fallen in here and there, the mountains of brick rubble and the collapsed ovens. The place was overgrown with weeds; no one ever visited it except Pavel and his two friends who sometimes came here to play. Pavel knew places where the stolen treasure could be safely hidden.

He climbed through a gap in one of the ovens and looked around him cautiously, but there was noone in sight. Only the pines soughed softly and a slight wind stirred the dust on the road. There was a strong smell of resin in the air.

Pavel placed the revolver wrapped in the rag in a corner of the oven floor and covered it with a small pyramid of old bricks. On the way out he filled the opening in the old oven with loose bricks, noted the exact location, and slowly set out for home, feeling his knees trembling under him.

"What will happen now?" he thought and his heart was heavy with foreboding.

To avoid going home he went to the power station earlier than usual. He took the key from the watchman and opened the wide doors leading into the powerhouse. And while he cleaned out the ashpit, pumped water into the boiler and started the fire going, he wondered what was happening at the Leszczinskis.

It was about eleven o'clock when Zhukhrai came and called Pavel outside.

"Why was there a search at your place today?" he asked in a low voice.

Pavel started.

"A search?"

"I don't like the look of it," Zhukhrai continued after a brief pause. "Sure you haven't any idea what they were looking for?"

Pavel knew very well what they had been looking for, but he could not risk telling Zhukhrai about the theft of the revolver. Trembling all over he asked:

"Have they arrested Artem?"

"Nobody was arrested, but they turned everything upside down in the house."

This reassured Pavel slightly, although his anxiety did not pass. For a few minutes both he and Zhukhrai stood there each wrapped in his own thoughts. One of the two knew why the search had been made and was worried about the consequences, the other did not and hence was on the alert.

"Damn them, maybe they've got wind of me somehow," Zhukhrai thought. "Artem knows nothing about me, but why did they search his place? Got to be more careful."

The two parted without a word and returned to their work.

The Leszczinski house was in a turmoil.

When the Lieutenant had noticed that the revolver was missing, he had called in his batman, who declared that the weapon must have been stolen; whereupon the officer had lost his temper and had smashed his fist into the batman's face. The batman, swaying from the impact of the blow,stood stiffly at attention, blinking and submissively awaiting further developments.

The lawyer, called in for an explanation, was loudly indignant at the theft and apologised to the Lieutenant for having allowed such a thing to occur in his house.

It was Victor Leszczinski who suggested that the revolver might have been stolen by the neighbours, and in particular by that young ruffian Pavel Korchagin. His father lost no time in passing on his son's conjecture to the Lieutenant, who at once ordered a search made.

The search was fruitless, and the episode of the missing revolver showed Pavel that even enterprises as risky as this could sometimes succeed.

一个惊天动地的消息像旋风一样刮进了这个小城：“沙皇被推翻了！”

城里的人都不敢相信。

一列火车在暴风雪中爬进了车站，两个穿军大衣、背步枪的大学生和一队戴红袖标的革命士兵从车上跳下来。他们逮捕了站上的宪兵、年老的上校和警备队长。城里的人这才相信传来的消息是真的了。于是几千个居民踏着积雪，穿过街道，涌到广场上去。

人们如饥似渴地听着那些新名词：自由、平等、博爱。

喧闹的、充满兴奋和喜悦的日子过去了。城里又恢复了平静，只有孟什维克和崩得分子［“崩得”，犹太社会民主主义总同盟的简称，是孟什维克的一个派别。——译者］把持的市参议会的楼房顶上那面红旗，才告诉人们发生了变动。其他一切都同过去一样。

冬末，城里进驻了一个近卫骑兵团。每天早晨，团里都派出骑兵小分队，到车站去抓从西南前线开小差下来的逃兵。

近卫骑兵个个红光满面，身材高大。军官大都是伯爵和公爵，戴着金色的肩章，马裤上镶着银色的绦子，一切都跟沙皇时代一模一样，好像没有发生过革命似的。

一九一七年匆匆离去了。对保尔、克利姆卡和谢廖沙来说，什么都没有改变。主人还是原来的那些家伙。只是到了多雨的十一月，情况才有点不同寻常。车站上出现了许多生人，他们大多是从前线回来的士兵，而且都有一个奇怪的称号：“布尔什维克”。

这个响亮的、有力的称号是从哪里来的，谁也不知道。

骑兵们要捉住从前线回来的逃兵可不那么容易。车站上枪声不断，被打碎的玻璃窗越来越多。士兵们成群结队地从前线跑回来，遇到阻拦，便用刺刀开路。到了十二月初，他们已经是成列车地涌来了。

车站上布满了近卫骑兵，准备截住列车，但是却遭到了车上机枪的迎头痛击。那些不怕死的人全都从车厢里冲了出来。

从前线回来的穿灰军衣的士兵把骑兵压回城里去了，然后他们回到车站，火车便一列跟着一列开了过去。

一九一八年的春天，三个好朋友在谢廖沙家玩了一阵子“六十六点”，就跑出来，到柯察金家小园子的草地上躺了下来。真是无聊，平时的那些游戏都玩腻了。他们开始动脑筋，怎么才能更好地消磨这一天的时间。这时，背后响起了得得的马蹄声，一个骑马的人沿着大路疾驰而来。那马一纵身，跳过了公路和小园子的低矮栅栏之间的排水沟。骑马的人朝躺在地上的保尔和克利姆卡挥了挥马鞭，说：“喂，小伙子们，过来！”

保尔和克利姆卡跳了起来，跑到栅栏跟前。骑马的人满身尘土，歪戴在后脑勺上的军帽和保护色的军便服全都落上了厚厚的一层灰尘。结实的军用皮带上，挂着一支转轮手枪和两颗德国造的手榴弹。

“小朋友，弄点水来喝喝！”骑马的人请求说。他见保尔跑回家去取水，就转过来问正瞧着他的谢廖沙：“小伙子，现在城里谁掌权？”

谢廖沙急急忙忙地讲起城里的各种消息来：“我们这儿已经有两个星期没人管了，只有一个自卫队，老百姓轮班守夜。你们是什么人？”他也提出了问题。

“我说你呀，操心操过头，转眼变成小老头。”骑马的人微笑着回答。

保尔端着一杯水，从家里跑出来。

骑马的人贪婪地一口气喝了个精光，把杯子还给保尔，接着一抖缰绳，立即朝松林驰去。

“他是干什么的？”保尔困惑地问克利姆卡。

“我怎么知道呢？”克利姆卡耸耸肩膀，回答说。

“大概又要换政府了，要不列辛斯基一家昨天怎么都跑了呢？有钱人跑了，那就是说，游击队要来了。”谢廖沙十拿九稳地解决了这个政治问题。

他的推论是那样令人信服，保尔和克利姆卡马上就都同意了。

三个朋友还没有谈论完这个问题，公路上又传来了得得的马蹄声。他们都朝栅栏跑去。

在他们目力所及的地方，从树林里，从林务官家的房后，转出来许多人和车辆，而在公路近旁，有十五六个人骑着马，枪横放在马鞍上，朝这边走来。最前面的两个，一个是中年人，穿着保护色军装，系着军官武装带，胸前挂着望远镜；另一个和他并排走的，正是三个朋友刚才见过的那个骑马的人。

中年人的上衣上别着一个红蝴蝶结。

“瞧，我说什么来着？”谢廖沙用胳膊肘从旁边捅了保尔一下。“看见了吧，红蝴蝶结。准是游击队，要不是游击队，就叫我瞎了眼……”说着，高兴得喊了一声，像小鸟似的越过栅栏，跳到外面去了。

两个朋友紧跟着也跳了出去。现在他们三个一起站在路旁，看着开过来的队伍。

那些骑马的人已经来到跟前。三个朋友刚才见过的那个人朝他们点了点头，用马鞭指着列辛斯基的房子，问：“这房子是谁家的？”

保尔紧紧跟在骑马的人后面，边走边说：“这是律师列辛斯基家的房子。他昨天就跑了，看样子是怕你们……”

“你怎么知道我们是什么人？”那个中年人微笑着问。

保尔指着红蝴蝶结，说：“这是什么？一眼就看得出来……”

居民们纷纷拥上街头，好奇地看着这支新开来的队伍。三个小朋友也站在路旁，望着这些浑身是土的、疲倦的红军战士。

队伍里唯一的一门大炮从石头道上隆隆驶过，架着机枪的马车也开过去了，这时候，他们就跟在游击队的后面，直到队伍停在市中心，开始分散到各家去住，他们才各自回家。

游击队的指挥部设在列辛斯基家的房子里，当天晚上，大客厅里那张四脚雕花的大桌子周围，四个人坐着在开会：一个是队长布尔加科夫同志，他是个已经有了白发的中年人，另外三个是指挥部的成员。

布尔加科夫在桌上打开一张本省地图，一边在图上移动指甲，寻找路线，一边向对面那个长着一口结实牙齿的高颧骨的人说：“叶尔马琴科同志，你说要在这儿打一仗，我倒认为应该明天一早就撤走。今天连夜撤最好，不过大家太累了。我们的任务是抢在德国人的前头，先赶到卡扎京。拿我们现有的这点兵力去抵抗，简直是开玩笑……一门炮，三十发炮弹，二百个步兵和六十个骑兵——能顶什么用……德国人正像洪水一样涌来。我们只有和其他后撤的红军部队联合在一起，才能作战。同志，我们还必须注意，除了德国人之外，沿路还有许多各式各样的反革命匪帮。我的意见是，明天一早就撤，把车站后面的那座小桥炸掉。德国人修桥得花两三天的时间。

这样，他们暂时就不能沿铁路线往前推进了。同志们，你们的意见怎么样？咱们决定一下吧。”他对在座的人说。

坐在布尔加科夫斜对面的斯特鲁日科夫动了一下嘴唇，看了看地图，又看了看布尔加科夫，终于很费劲地从嗓子眼里挤出一句话来：“我……赞……成布尔加科夫的意见。”

那个穿工人服的年轻人也表示同意：“布尔加科夫说得有道理。”

只有叶尔马琴科，就是白天跟三个朋友谈过话的那个人，摇头反对。他说：“那我们还建立这支队伍干什么？是为了在德国人面前不战而退吗？照我的意见，我们应当在这儿跟他们干一仗。跑得叫人腻烦了……要是由着我的性子，非在这儿打一仗不可。”他猛然把椅子推开，站起身，在屋里踱起步来。

布尔加科夫不以为然地看了他一眼。

“仗要打得有道理，叶尔马琴科同志。明知道是吃败仗，是送死，还硬要战士往上冲，这种事咱们不能干。要这样干，就太可笑了。在咱们后面，有敌人一个整师，而且配备有重炮和装甲车……叶尔马琴科同志，咱们可不能耍小孩子脾气……”接着他对大家说：“就这么决定了，明天一早撤。”

“下一个是建立联系的问题。”布尔加科夫继续说。“因为咱们是最后一批撤，当然就得担负起组织敌后工作的任务。这儿是铁路枢纽站，地方不大，可是有两个车站。应当安排一个可靠的同志在车站上工作。现在咱们就决定一下，把谁留下来。大家提名吧。”

“我认为应当把水兵朱赫来留下来。”叶尔马琴科走到桌子跟前，说。“第一，朱赫来是本地人；第二，他又会钳工，又会电工，准能在车站上找到工作。另外，谁也没有看见他跟咱们的队伍在一起，他今天夜里才能赶到。这个人很有头脑，一定能把这儿的事情办好。依我看，他是最合适的人选。”

布尔加科夫点了点头，说：“对，叶尔马琴科，我同意你的意见。同志们，你们有没有反对意见？”他问另外两个人。“没有。那么，就这样定了。咱们给朱赫来留下一笔钱和委任令。”

“同志们，现在讨论第三个，也是最后一个问题，”布尔加科夫接着说。“就是处理本地存放的武器问题。这儿存着一大批步枪，一共有两万支，还是沙皇那个时候打仗留下来的。

这些枪支堆放在一个农民的棚子里，人们早都忘记了。棚子的主人把这件事告诉了我。他不愿再担这个风险……把这批枪留给德国人，当然是不行的。我认为应该把枪烧掉。马上就得动手，赶在天亮以前把一切都办妥。不过烧起来也有危险：棚子就在城边上，周围住的都是穷苦人，说不定会把农民的房子也烧掉。”

斯特鲁日科夫是个身板很结实的人，胡子又粗又硬，已经很久没有刮了。他欠了一下身子，说：“干……吗……要烧掉？我认……认为应当把这些枪发给居……民。”

布尔加科夫立即转过脸去，问他：“你是说把这些枪都发出去？”

“对，太对了！”叶尔马琴科热烈地拥护说。“把这些枪发给工人和别的老百姓，谁要就给谁。德国人要是逼得大家走投无路，这些枪至少可以给他们点颜色看看。德国人来了，日子肯定不好过。到了受不了的时候，人们就会拿起武器反抗。斯特鲁日科夫说得很好：把枪发下去。要是能运一些到乡下去，那就更好了。农民会把枪藏得更严实，一旦德国人征用老百姓的财物，逼得他们倾家荡产，嘿，你就瞧吧，这些可爱的枪支该能发挥多大作用啊！”

布尔加科夫笑了起来：“是呀，不过德国人一定会下令，让把枪都交回去，到时候就都交出去了。”

叶尔马琴科反驳说：“不，不会都交出去的，有人交，也有人不交。”

布尔加科夫用询问的眼光挨个看了看在座的人。

“把枪发下去，发吧。”那个年轻工人也赞成叶尔马琴科和斯特鲁日科夫的意见。

“好吧，那就发下去。”布尔加科夫也同意了。“问题都讨论完了。”说着，他从桌旁站了起来。“现在咱们可以休息到明天早晨。等朱赫来到了，让他到我这儿来一下。我要跟他谈谈。叶尔马琴科，你查查岗去吧。”

大家都走了，只剩下布尔加科夫一个人。他走进客厅旁边原房主的卧室，把军大衣铺在垫子上，躺了下来。

早晨，保尔从发电厂回家去。他在厂里当锅炉工助手已经整整一年了。

今天城里非常热闹，不同往常。这一点他一下子就发现了。一路上，拿着步枪的人越来越多，有的一支，有的两支，还有拿三支的。保尔不明白是怎么回事，急忙往家走。在列辛斯基的庄园近旁，他昨天见到的那些人正在上马，准备出发。

保尔跑到家里，匆匆忙忙地洗了把脸，听母亲说阿尔焦姆还没有回来，随即跑了出去，直奔城的另一头，去找住在那里的谢廖沙。

谢廖沙是一个副司机的儿子。他父亲自己有一所小房子，还有一份薄家当。谢廖沙不在家。他的母亲，一个胖胖的白净妇女，不满地看了保尔一眼。

“鬼才知道他上哪儿去了！天刚蒙蒙亮，就让魔鬼给拽跑了，说是什么地方在发枪，他准在那儿。你们这帮鼻涕将军，都欠用柳条抽。太不像话了，真拿你们没办法。比瓦罐才高两寸，也要跑去领枪。你告诉我那个小无赖，别说枪，就是带回一粒子弹，我也要揪下他的脑袋。什么乱七八糟的东西都往家拿，往后还得受他连累。你干吗，也想上那儿去？”

保尔早就不再听谢廖沙的母亲唠叨，他一阵风似的跑了出去。

路上过来一个人，两肩各背着一支步枪。保尔飞快跑到他跟前，问：“大叔，请问，枪在哪儿领？”

“在韦尔霍维纳大街，那儿正在发呢。”

保尔撒开腿，拼命朝那个地点跑去。他跑过两条街，碰见一个小男孩拖着一支沉重的、带刺刀的步枪。保尔拦住他，问：“你从哪儿搞来的枪？”

“游击队在学校对面发的，现在一支也没有了，全都拿光了。发了整整一夜，现在只剩下一堆空箱子了。我连这支一共拿了两支。”小男孩得意洋洋地说。

这个消息使保尔大为懊丧。

“咳，真见鬼，直接跑到那儿去就好了，不该先回家！”他失望地想。“我怎么错过了这个机会呢？”

突然，他灵机一动，急忙转过身来，三步并作两步，赶上已经走过去的小男孩，一把从他手里夺过枪来。

“你已经有了一支，够了，这支该是我的。”保尔用一种不容争辩的口气说。

小男孩见他大白天拦路抢劫，气得要命，就朝他直扑过去。保尔向后退了一步，端起刺刀，喊道：“走开，小心刺刀碰着你！”

小男孩心疼得哭了起来，但是又没有办法，只好一边骂，一边转身跑开了。保尔却心满意足地跑回家去。他跳过栅栏，跑进小棚子，把弄来的枪藏在棚顶下面的梁上，然后开心地吹着口哨，走进屋里。

在乌克兰，像舍佩托夫卡这样的小城——中心是市区，四郊是农村——夏天的夜晚是美丽的。

一到夏天，在宁静的夜晚，年轻人全都跑到外面来。姑娘们和小伙子们，或者成群成帮，或者成双成对，有的在自家门口，有的在花园和庭院里，有的就在大街上，坐在盖房用的木料堆上。到处是欢笑，到处是歌声。

微微流动的空气里，充溢着浓郁的花香；星星像萤火虫一样，在天空的深处闪着微光；人声传得很远很远……

保尔挺喜欢他的手风琴。他总是爱惜地把那架维也纳造的、音色优美的双键手风琴放在膝上。灵活的手指刚刚触到键盘，便飞快地由上面滑到下面。低音键长长地吐了一口气，接着便奏出大胆的跳跃式的旋律。

手风琴扭动身子，起劲地演奏着。在这样的时候，你怎么能不闻声起舞，跳个痛快呢？你是忍不住的，两只脚会不由自主地动起来。手风琴热情地演奏着——生活在人世间是多么美好啊！

今天晚上特别欢畅。一群年轻人聚在保尔家对面的木料堆上，又说又笑。声音最响亮的是保尔的邻居加莉娜。这个石匠的女儿喜欢跟男孩子们一起唱歌、跳舞。她是女中音，声音又嘹亮，又圆润。

保尔一向有点怕她。她口齿很伶俐。现在她挨着保尔坐在木料堆上，紧紧搂住他，大声笑着说：“嘿，你这个手风琴手可真棒！可惜就是小了点，要不然倒是我称心如意的小女婿！我就爱拉手风琴的，他们把我的心都融化了。”

保尔羞得满脸通红，幸亏是晚上，谁也看不见。他想推开这个淘气的女孩子，可是她却紧紧地搂住他不放。

“亲爱的，你要往哪儿躲？真是个小冤家！”她开玩笑地说。

保尔觉得她那富有弹性的胸脯贴在他的肩膀上，他感到局促不安，四周的笑声却惊醒了素常寂静的街道。

保尔用手推着加莉娜的肩膀，说：“你妨碍我拉琴了，离远点吧。”

于是又是一阵戏谑和哄笑。

玛鲁霞插嘴说：“保尔，拉一个忧伤点的曲子吧，要能动人心弦的。”

手风琴的风箱缓缓地拉开了，手指慢慢地移动着。这是一首大家都熟悉的家乡曲调。加莉娜带头唱起来。玛鲁霞和其他人随即跟上：

所有的纤夫

都回到了故乡，

唱起歌儿

抒发心头的忧伤，

我们感到亲切，

我们感到舒畅……

青年们嘹亮的歌声传向远方，传向森林。

“保尔！”这是阿尔焦姆的声音。

保尔收起手风琴，扣好皮带。

“叫我了，我得走了。”

玛鲁霞央求他说：“再呆一会儿，再拉几个吧，耽误不了回家。”

但是，保尔忙着要走，他说：“不行，明天再玩吧，现在该回家了，阿尔焦姆叫我呢。”

他穿过马路，朝家跑去。

他推开房门，看到阿尔焦姆的同事罗曼坐在桌子旁边，另外还有一个陌生人。

“你叫我吗？”保尔问。

阿尔焦姆向保尔点了点头，然后对那个陌生人说：“他就是我的弟弟。”

陌生人向保尔伸出了一只粗大的手。

“是这么回事，保尔。”阿尔焦姆对弟弟说。“你不是说你们发电厂的电工病了吗？明天你打听一下，他们要不要雇一个内行人替他。要的话，你回来告诉一声。”

那个人插嘴说：“不用了，我跟他一块去。我自己跟老板谈吧。”

“当然要雇人啦。”保尔说。“因为电工斯坦科维奇生病，今天机器都停了。老板跑来两趟，要找个替工，就是没找到。

单靠一个锅炉工就发电，他又不敢。我们的电工得的是伤寒病。”

“这么说，事情就算妥了。”陌生人说。“明天我来找你，咱俩一块去。”他对保尔说。

“好吧。”

保尔看到他那双安详的灰眼睛正在仔细观察他。那坚定的凝视的目光使保尔有点不好意思。灰色的短上衣从上到下都扣着纽扣，紧紧箍在结实的宽肩膀上，显得太瘦了。他的脖子跟牛一样粗，整个人就像一棵粗壮的老柞树，浑身充满力量。

他临走的时候，阿尔焦姆对他说：“好吧，再见，朱赫来。明天你跟我弟弟一块去，事情会办妥的。”

游击队撤走三天之后，德国人进了城。几天来一直冷冷清清的车站上，响起了火车头的汽笛声，这就是他们到来的信号。消息马上传遍了全城：“德国人来了。”

虽然大家早就知道德国人要来，全城还是像捅开了的蚂蚁窝一样，立即忙乱起来，而且对这件事总还有点半信半疑。

这些可怕的德国人居然已经不是远在天边，而是近在眼前，开到城里来了。

所有的居民都贴着栅栏和院门，向外张望，不敢到街上去。

德国人不走马路中间，而是排成两个单行，沿路的两侧行进。他们穿着墨绿色的制服，平端着枪，枪上上着宽刺刀，头上戴着沉重的钢盔，身上背着大行军袋。他们把队伍拉成长条，从车站到市区，连绵不断；他们小心翼翼地走着，随时准备应付抵抗，虽然并没有人想抵抗他们。

走在队伍前头的，是两个拿着毛瑟枪的军官，马路当中是一个担任翻译的乌克兰伪军小头目，他穿着蓝色的乌克兰短上衣，戴着一顶羊皮高帽。

德国人在市中心的广场上列成方阵，打起鼓来。只有少数老百姓壮着胆聚拢过来。穿乌克兰短上衣的伪军小头目走上一家药房的台阶，大声宣读了城防司令科尔夫少校的命令。

命令如下：

第一条本市全体居民，限于二十四小时内，将所有火器及其他各种武器缴出，违者枪决。

第二条本市宣布戒严，自晚八时起禁止通行。

城防司令科尔夫少校

从前的市参议会所在地，革命后是工人代表苏维埃的办公处，现在又成了德军城防司令部。房前的台阶旁边站着一个卫兵，他头上戴的已经不是钢盔，而是缀着一个很大的鹰形帝国徽章的军帽了。院子里划出一块地方，用来堆放收缴的武器。

整天都有怕被枪毙的居民来缴武器。成年人不敢露面，来送枪的都是年轻人和小孩。德国人没有扣留一个人。

那些不愿去交枪的人，就在夜里把枪扔到马路上，第二天早上，德国巡逻兵把枪捡起来，装上军用马车，运到城防司令部去。

中午十二点多钟，规定缴枪的期限一过，德国兵就清点了他们的战利品，收到的步枪总共是一万四千支，这就是说，还有六千支没有交给德国人。他们挨家挨户进行了搜查，但是搜到的很少。

第二天清晨，在城外古老的犹太人墓地旁边，有两个铁路工人被枪毙了，因为在他们家里搜出了步枪。

阿尔焦姆一听到命令，就急忙赶回家来。他在院子里遇到了保尔，一把抓住他的肩膀，郑重其事地小声问道：“你从外面往家拿什么东西没有？”

保尔本来想瞒住步枪的事，但是又不愿意对哥哥撒谎，就全都照实说了。

他们一起走进小棚子。阿尔焦姆把藏在梁上的枪取下来，卸下枪栓和刺刀，然后抓起枪筒，抡开膀子，使出浑身力量向栅栏的柱子砸去，把枪托砸得粉碎。没碎的部分则远远地扔到了小园子外面的荒地里，回头又把刺刀和枪栓扔进了茅坑。

完事以后，阿尔焦姆转身对弟弟说：“你已经不是小孩子了，保尔，你也明白，武器可不是闹着玩的。我得跟你说清楚，往后什么也不许往家拿。你知道，现在为这种事连命都会送掉。记住，不许瞒着我，要是你把这种东西带回来，让他们发现了，头一个抓去枪毙的就是我。

你还是个毛孩子，他们倒是不会碰你的。眼下正是兵荒马乱的时候，你明白吗？”

保尔答应以后再也不往家拿东西。

当他们穿过院子往屋里走的时候，一辆四轮马车在列辛斯基家的大门口停住了。律师和他的妻子，还有两个孩子——涅莉和维克托从车里走出来。

“这些宝贝又回来了，”阿尔焦姆恶狠狠地说。“又有好戏看了，他妈的！”说着就进屋去了。

保尔为枪的事难过了一整天。在同一天，他的朋友谢廖沙却在一个没有人要的破棚子里，拼命用铁锹挖土。他终于在墙根底下挖好一个大坑，把领到的三支新枪用破布包好，放了下去。他不想把这些枪交给德国人，昨天夜里他翻来覆去折腾了一宿，怎么想也舍不得这些已经到手的宝贝。

他用土把坑填好，夯结实了，又弄来一大堆垃圾和破烂，盖在新土上。然后又从各方面检查了一番，觉得挑不出什么毛病了，这才摘下帽子，擦掉额上的汗珠。

“这回让他们搜吧，就是搜到了，也查不清是谁家的棚子。”

朱赫来在发电厂工作已经一个月了，保尔不知不觉地和这个严肃的电工成了亲密的朋友。

朱赫来常常给他讲解发电机的构造，教他电工技术。

水兵朱赫来很喜欢这个机灵的孩子。空闲的日子，他常常来看望阿尔焦姆。这个通情达理、严肃认真的水兵，总是耐心地倾听他们讲日常生活中的各种事情，尤其是母亲埋怨保尔淘气的时候，他更是耐心地听下去。他总会想出办法来安慰玛丽亚·雅科夫列夫娜，劝得她心里舒舒坦坦的，忘掉了种种烦恼。

有一天，保尔走过发电厂院子里的木柴堆，朱赫来叫住了他，微笑着对他说：“你母亲说你爱打架。她说：‘我那个孩子总好干仗，活像只公鸡。’”朱赫来赞许地大笑起来，接着又说：“打架并不算坏事，不过得知道打谁，为什么打。”

保尔不知道朱赫来是取笑他还是说正经话，便回答说：“我可不平白无故地打架，总是有理才动手的。”

朱赫来出其不意地对他说：“打架要有真本领，我教你，好不好？”

保尔惊讶地看了他一眼。

“有真本领怎么打？”

“好，你瞧着。”

他简要地说了说英国式拳击的打法，给保尔上了第一课。

保尔为了掌握这套本领，吃了不少苦头，但是他学得很不错。在朱赫来的拳头打击下，他不知摔了多少个倒栽葱，但是这个徒弟很勤奋，还是耐着性子学下去。

有一天，天气很热，保尔从克利姆卡家回来，在屋子里转悠了一阵子，没有什么活要干，就决定到房后园子角落里的小棚顶上去，那是他最喜爱的地方。他穿过院子，走进小园子，登着墙上凸出的地方，爬上了棚顶。他拨开板棚上面繁茂的樱桃树枝，爬到棚顶当中，躺在暖洋洋的阳光下。

这棚子有一面对着列辛斯基家的花园，要是爬到棚顶的边上，就可以望见整个花园和前面的房子。保尔把头探过棚顶，看到了院落的一角和一辆停在那里的四轮马车。他看见住在列辛斯基家的德国中尉的勤务兵正在用刷子刷他长官的衣物。保尔常常在列辛斯基家的大门口看到那个中尉。

那个中尉粗短身材，红脸膛，留着一小撮剪得短短的胡须，戴着夹鼻眼镜和漆皮帽舌的军帽。保尔知道他住在厢房里，窗子正朝着花园，从棚顶上可以看得清清楚楚。

这时，中尉正在桌旁写什么东西。过了一会儿，他拿着写好的东西走了出去。他把一封信交给勤务兵，就沿着花园的小径朝临街的栅栏门走去。走到凉亭旁边，他站住了，显然是在跟谁说话。涅莉从凉亭里走了出来。中尉挎着她的胳膊，两个人出了栅栏门，上街去了。

这一切保尔都看在眼里。他正打算睡一会儿，又看见勤务兵走进中尉的房间，把中尉的军服挂在衣架上，打开朝花园的窗子，收拾完屋子，走了出去，随手带上了门。转眼间，保尔看见他已经到了拴着马的马厩旁边。

保尔朝敞开的窗口望去，整个房间看得一清二楚。桌子上放着一副皮带，还有一件发亮的东西。

保尔为按捺不住的好奇心所驱使，悄悄地从棚顶爬到樱桃树上，顺着树身溜到列辛斯基家的花园里。他弯着腰，几个箭步就到了敞开的窗子跟前，朝屋里看了一眼。桌子上放着一副武装带和一支装在皮套里的很漂亮的十二发曼利赫尔手枪。

保尔连气都喘不上来了。有几秒钟的工夫，他心里斗争得很激烈，但是最后还是被一种力量所支配，他不顾死活，把身子探进窗子，抓住枪套，拔出那支乌亮的新手枪，然后又跳回了花园。他向四周环顾了一下，小心翼翼地把枪塞进裤袋，迅速穿过花园，向樱桃树跑去。他像猴子似的攀上棚顶，又回过头来望了一眼。勤务兵正安闲地跟马夫聊

Part One Chapter 3
---

Tonya stood at the open window and pensively surveyed the familiar garden bordered by the stately poplars now stirring faintly in the gentle breeze. She could hardly believe that a whole year had passed since she had been here where her childhood years had been spent. It seemed that she had left home only yesterday and returned by this morning's train. 

Nothing had changed: the rows of raspberry bushes were as carefully trimmed as ever, and the garden paths, lined with pansies, mother's favourite flowers, were laid out with the same geometric precision. Everything in the garden was neat and tidy—evidence of the pedantic hand of the dendrologist. The sight of these clean-swept, neatly drawn paths bored Tonya. 

She picked up the novel she had been reading, opened the door leading to the veranda and walked down the stairs into the garden; she pushed open the little painted wicket gate and slowly headed for the pond next to the station pump house. 

She passed the bridge and came out on the tree-lined road. On her right was the pond fringed with willows and alders; on the left the forest began. 

She was on her way to the ponds at the old stone-quarry when the sight of a fishing rod swung over the water made her pause. 

Leaning over the trunk of a twisted willow, she parted the branches and saw before her a suntanned, barefoot boy with trouser legs rolled up above the knee. Next to him was a rusty can with worms. The lad was too engrossed in his occupation to notice her. 

"Do you think you can catch fish here?" 

Pavel glanced angrily over his shoulder. 

A girl in a white sailor blouse with a striped blue collar and a short light-grey skirt stood on the bank, holding on to the willow and bending low over the water. Short socks with a coloured edging clung to her shapely suntanned legs. Her chestnut hair was gathered in a heavy braid. 

A slight tremor shook the hand holding the fishing rod and the goose-feather float bobbed, sending circles spreading over the smoothness of the water. 

"Look, look, a bite!" the excited voice piped behind Pavel. 

He now lost his composure completely and jerked at the line so hard that the hook with the squirming worm on the end of it fairly leapt out of the water. 

"Not much chance to fish now, damn it! What the devil brought her here," Pavel thought irritably and in order to cover up his clumsiness cast the hook farther out, landing it, however, exactly where he should not have—between two burdocks where the line could easily get caught. 

He realised what had happened and without turning around, hissed at the girl sitting above him on the bank: 

"Can't you keep quiet? You'll scare off all the fish that way." 

From above came the mocking voice: 

"Your black looks have scared the fish away long ago. No self-respecting angler goes fishing in the afternoon anyway!" 

Pavel had done his best to behave politely but this was too much for him. He got up and pushed his cap over his eyes, as he usually did when roused. 

"You'd do better, miss, if you took yourself off," he muttered through his teeth, drawing on the most inoffensive part of his vocabulary. 

Tonya's eyes narrowed slightly and laughter danced in them.

"Am I really interfering?" 

The teasing note had gone from her voice and given way to a friendly, conciliatory tone, and Pavel, who had primed himself to be really rude to this "missy" who had sprung from nowhere, found himself disarmed. 

"You can stay and watch, if you want to. It's all the same to me," he said grudgingly and sat down to attend to the float again. It had got stuck in the burdock and there was no doubt that the hook had caught in the roots. Pavel was afraid to pull at it. If it caught he would not be able to get it loose. And the girl would be sure to laugh. He wished she would go away. 

Tonya, however, had settled more comfortably on the slightly swaying willow trunk and with her book on her knees was watching the sun-tanned, dark-eyed, rough-mannered young man who had given her such an ungracious reception and was now deliberately ignoring her. 

Pavel saw the girl clearly reflected in the mirror-like surface of the pond, and when she seemed to be absorbed in her book he cautiously pulled at the entangled line. The float ducked under the water and the line grew taut. 

"Caught, damn it!" flashed in his mind and at the same moment he saw out of the corner of his eye the laughing face of the girl looking up at him from the water. 

Just then two young men, both seventh-grade Gymnasium students, were coming across the bridge at the pump house. One of them was the seventeen-year-old son of engineer Sukharko, the chief of the railway yards, a loutish, fair-haired, freckle-faced scapegrace whom his schoolmates had clubbed Pockmarked Shurka. He was carrying a fancy fishing rod and line and had a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth. With him was Victor Leszczinski, a tall, effeminate youth. 

"Now this girl is a peach, there's nobody like her about here," Sukharko was saying, winking significantly as he bent toward his companion. "You can take my word for it that she's chock-full of r-r-romance. She's in the sixth grade and goes to school in Kiev. Now she's come to spend the summer with her father—he's the chief forest warden here. My sister Liza knows her. I wrote her a letter once in a sentimental sort of vein. 'I love you madly'—you know the sort of thing—'and await your answer in trepidation'. Even dug up some suitable verses from Nadson." 

"Well, what came of it?" Victor asked curiously. 

"Oh, she was frightfully stuck up about it," Sukharko muttered rather sheepishly. "Told me not to waste paper writing letters and all that. But that's how it always is in the beginning. I'm an old hand at this sort of thing. As a matter of fact I can't be bothered with all that romantic nonsense— mooning about for ages, sighing. It's much simpler to take a stroll of an evening down to the repairmen's barracks where for three rubles you can pick up a beauty that'd make your mouth water. And no nonsense either. I used to go out there with Valka Tikhonov—do you know him? 

The foreman on the railway." 

Victor scowled in disgust. 

"Do you mean to tell me you go in for foul stuff like that, Shura?" 

Shura chewed at his cigarette, spat and replied with a sneer: 

"Don't pretend to be so virtuous. We know what you go in for." 

Victor interrupted him. 

"Will you introduce me to this peach of yours?" 

"Of course. Let's hurry or she'll give us the slip. Yesterday morning she went fishing by herself." 

As the two friends came up to Tonya, Sukharko took the cigarette out of his mouth and greeted her with a gallant bow.

"How do you do, Mademoiselle Tumanova. Have you come to fish too?"

"No, I'm just watching," replied Tonya.

"You two haven't met, have you?" Sukharko hastened to put in, taking Victor by the arm. "This ismy friend Victor Leszczinski."

Victor, blushing, extended his hand to Tonya.

"And why aren't you fishing today?" Sukharko inquired in an effort to keep up the conversation.

"I forgot to bring my rod," Tonya replied.

"I'll get another one right away," Sukharko said. "In the meantime you can have mine. I'll be backin a minute."

He had kept his promise to Victor to introduce him to the girl and was now anxious to leave themalone.

"I'd rather not, we should only be in the way. There's somebody fishing here already," said Tonya.

"In whose way?" Sukharko asked. "Oh, you mean him?" For the first time he noticed Pavel who was sitting under a bush. "Well, I'll get rid of him in two shakes."

Before Tonya could stop him he had slipped down to where Pavel was busy with his rod and line.

"Pull in that line of yours and clear out," Sukharko told Pavel. "Hurry up now. . ." he added as Pavel continued fishing calmly.

Pavel looked up and gave Sukharko a glance that boded no good.

"Shut up. Who do you think you are!"

"Wha-at!" Sukharko exploded. "You've got the cheek to answer back, you wretched tramp! Clear out of here!" He kicked violently at the can of worms which spun around in the air and fell into the pond, splashing water in Tonya's face.

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Sukharko!" she cried.

Pavel leapt to his feet. He knew that Sukharko was the son of the chief of the railway yards where Artem worked, and that if he hit that flabby, mousy mug of his he would complain to his father and Artem would get into trouble. This alone prevented him from settling the matter then andthere.

Sensing that Pavel would hit out at him in another moment, Sukharko rushed forward and pushed him in the chest with both hands. Pavel, standing at the water's edge, teetered dangerously, but by frantically waving his arms regained his balance and saved himself from falling in.

Sukharko was two years older than Pavel and notorious as a troublemaker and bully. The blow in the chest made Pavel see red.

"So, that's what you want! Take this!" And with a short swing of his arm he punched Sukharko's face. Before the latter had time to recover, Pavel seized him firmly by his uniform blouse,clinched him and dragged him into the water.

Knee-deep in the pond, his polished shoes and trousers soaking wet, Sukharko struggled with all his might to wrench himself loose from Pavel's powerful grip. Having achieved his purpose, Pavel jumped ashore. The enraged Sukharko charged after him, ready to tear him to pieces.

As he spun around to face his opponent, Pavel remembered:

"Rest your weight on your left foot, with your right leg tense and right knee bent. Put the weight of your whole body behind the punch and strike upward, at the point of the chin."

Crack!

Sukharko's teeth clicked as Pavel's fist struck. Squealing from the excruciating pain that shot through his chin and his tongue which was caught between the teeth, Sukharko flailed wildly with his arms and fell back into the water with a loud splash.

Up on the bank Tonya was doubled up with laughter.

"Bravo, bravo!" she cried, clapping her hands. "Well done!"

Seizing his entangled fishing line, Pavel jerked at it so hard that it snapped, and scrambled up the bank to the road.

"That's Pavel Korchagin, a rowdy if there ever was one," he heard Victor say to Tonya as he went.

There was trouble brewing at the station. Rumour had it that the railwaymen on the line were downing tools.

The workers of the yards at the next large station had started something big. The Germans arrested two engine drivers suspected of carrying proclamations with them. And among the workers who had ties with the countryside there was serious ferment because of the requisitioning and the

return of landlords to their estates.

The lashes of the Hetman's guards seared the backs of the peasants. The partisan movement was developing in the gubernia; the Bolsheviks had already organised nearly a dozen partisan detachments.

There was no rest for Zhukhrai these days. During his stay in the town he had accomplished a great deal. He had made the acquaintance of many railway workers, attended gatherings of young folk, and built up a strong group among the mechanics at the railway yards and the sawmill workers. He tried to find out where Artem stood, and he asked him once what he thought about the Bolshevik Party and its cause.

"I don't know much about these parties, Fyodor," the burly mechanic replied. "But if there's help needed, you can count on me."

Fyodor was satisfied, for he knew that Artem was made of the right stuff and would stand by his word. As for the Party, he wasn't ready for that yet. "Never mind," he thought, "in times like these he'll soon learn for himself."

Fyodor left the power station for a job at the railway yards, where it was easier for him to carry on his work. At the electric station he had been cut off from the railway.

Traffic on the railway was exceedingly heavy. The Germans were shipping carloads of loot by the thousand from the Ukraine to Germany: rye, wheat, cattle. . . .

One day the Hetman's guards arrested Ponomarenko, the station telegrapher. He was taken to the guardhouse and brutally beaten. It was he, evidently, who gave away Roman Sidorenko, a workmate of Artem's.

Two Germans and a Hetman's guard, the Station Commandant's Assistant, came for Roman during working hours. Without saying a word, the Assistant Commandant walked over to the bench where Roman was working and cut him across the face with his riding crop.

"Come along, you sonofabitch!" he said. "You've got some explaining to do!" With an ugly leer he seized hold of the mechanic's arm and wrenched it violently. "We'll teach you to go around agitating!"

Artem, who had been working at the vice next to Roman, dropped his file and came at the Assistant Commandant, his massive frame menacingly poised. 

"Keep your fists off him, you bastard!" Artem spoke hoarsely, doing his best to restrain his rising fury. 

The Assistant Commandant fell back, unfastening his holster as he did so. One of the Germans, a short-legged man, unslung his heavy rifle with the broad-bladed bayonet from his shoulder and sharply clicked the bolt. 

"Halt!" he barked, ready to shoot at another move. 

The tall, brawny mechanic stood helpless before the puny soldier; he could do nothing. 

Both Roman and Artem were placed under arrest. Artem was released an hour later, but Roman was locked up in a luggage room in the basement. 

Ten minutes after the arrest not a single man was working. The railway yard workers assembled in the station park where they were joined by the switchmen and the men employed at the supply warehouses. Feeling ran high and someone drafted a written demand for the release of Roman and 

Ponomarenko. 

Indignation rose higher still when the Assistant Commandant rushed into the park at the head of a group of guards brandishing a revolver and shouting: 

"Back to work, or we'll arrest every last man of you on the spot! And put some of you up against the wall!" 

The infuriated workers replied with a bellow that sent him running for cover to the station. In the meantime, however, the Station Commandant had summoned German troops from the town and truckloads of them were already careering down the road leading to the station. 

The workers dispersed and hurried home. No one, not even the stationmaster, remained on the job. 

Zhukhrai's work was beginning to make itself felt; this was the first time the workers at the station had taken mass action. 

The Germans mounted a heavy machine gun on the platform; it stood there like a pointer that has spotted a quarry. Next to it squatted a German corporal, his hand resting on the trigger grip. 

The station grew deserted. 

At night the arrests began. Artem was among those taken. Zhukhrai escaped by not going home that night. 

All the arrested men were herded together in a huge freight shed and given the alternative of either returning to work or being court-martialled. 

Practically all the railwaymen were on strike all along the line. For a day and a night not a single train went through, and one hundred and twenty kilometres away a battle was being fought with a large partisan detachment which had cut the railway line and blown up the bridges. 

During the night a German troop train pulled in but was held up because the engine driver, his helper and the fireman had deserted the locomotive. There were two more trains on the station sidings waiting to leave. 

The heavy doors of the freight shed swung open and in walked the Station Commandant, a German lieutenant, his assistant, and a group of other Germans. 

"Korchagin, Polentovsky, Bruzzhak," the Commandant's Assistant called out. "You will make up an engine crew and take a train out at once. If you refuse, you will be shot on the spot. What do you say?" 

The three workers nodded sullen consent. They were escorted under guard to the locomotive while the Commandant's Assistant went on to call out the names of the driver, helper and fireman for the next train.

The locomotive snorted angrily, sending up geysers of sparks. Breathing heavily it breasted the gloom ahead as it pounded along the track into the depths of night. Artem, who had just shovelled coal into the firebox, kicked the door shut, took a gulp of water from the snubnosed teapot

standing on the toolbox, and turned to Polentovsky, the old engine driver.

"Well, pa, are we taking it through?"

Polentovsky's eyes blinked irritably under their overhanging eyebrows.

"You will when there's a bayonet at your back."

"We could chuck everything and make a dash for it," suggested Bruzzhak, watching the German soldier sitting on the tender from the corner of his eye.

"I think so too," muttered Artem, "if it wasn't for that bird behind our backs."

"That's right," Bruzzhak was noncommittal as he stuck his head out of the window.

Polentovsky moved closer to Artem.

"We can't take the train through, understand?" he whispered. "There's fighting going on ahead.

Our fellows have blown up the track. And here we are bringing these swine there so they can shoot them down. You know, son, even in the tsar's time I never drove an engine when there was a strike on, and I'm not going to do it now. We'd disgrace ourselves for life if we brought destruction down on our own kind. The other engine crew ran away, didn't they? They risked their

lives, but they did it. We just can't take the train through. What do you think?"

"You're right, pa, but what are you going to do about him?" and he indicated the soldier with a glance.

The engine driver scowled. He wiped his sweating forehead with a handful of waste and stared with bloodshot eyes at the pressure gauge as if seeking an answer there to the question tormenting him. Then he swore in fury and desperation.

Artem drank again from the teapot. The two men were thinking of one thing, but neither could bring himself to break the tense silence. Artem recalled Zhukhrai's question: "Well, brother, what do you think about the Bolshevik Party and the Gommunist idea?" and his own reply: "I am always ready to help, you can count on me. . . ."

"A fine way to help," he thought, "driving a punitive expedition. . . ."

Polentovsky was now bending over the toolbox next to Artem. Hoarsely he said:

"That fellow, we've got to do him in. Understand?"

Artem started. Polentovsky added through clenched teeth:

"There's no other way out. Got to knock him over the head and chuck the throttle and the levers into the firebox, cut off the steam and then run for it."

Feeling as if a heavy weight had dropped off his shoulders Artem said: "Right!" Leaning toward Bruzzhak, Artem told him of their decision.

Bruzzhak did not answer at once. They all were taking a very great risk. Each had a family at home to think of. Polentovsky's was the largest: he had nine mouths to feed. But all three knew that they could not take the train to its destination.

"Good, I'm with you," Bruzzhak said. "But what about him? Who's going to. . . ." He did not finish the sentence but his meaning was clear enough to Artem. 

Artem turned to Polentovsky, who was now busy with the throttle, and nodded as if to say that Bruzzhak agreed with them, but then, tormented by a question still unsettled, he stepped closer to the old man. 

"But how?" 

Polentovsky looked at Artem. 

"You begin, you're the strongest. We'll conk him with the crowbar and it'll be all over." The old man was violently agitated. 

Artem frowned. 

"I can't do it. I can't. After all, when you come to think of it, the man isn't to blame. He's also been forced into this at the point of the bayonet." 

Polentovsky's eyes flashed. 

"Not to blame, you say? Neither are we for being made to do this ]ob. But don't forget it's a punitive expedition we're hauling. These innocents are going out to shoot down partisans. Are the partisans to blame then? No, my lad, you've mighty little sense for all that you're strong as an ox. . . ." 

"All right, all right," Artem's voice cracked. He picked up the crowbar, but Polentovsky whispered to him: 

"I'll do it, be more certain that way. You take the shovel and climb up to pass down the coal from the tender. If necessary you give him one with the shovel. I'll pretend to be loosening up the coal." 

Bruzzhak heard what was said, and nodded. "The old man's right," he said, and took his place at the throttle. 

The German soldier in his forage cap with a red band around it was sitting at the edge of the tender holding his rifle between his feet and smoking a cigar. From time to time he threw a glance at the engine crew going about their work in the cab. 

When Artem climbed up on top of the tender the sentry paid little attention to him. And when Polentovsky, who pretended he wanted to get at the larger chunks of coal next to the side of the tender, signed to him to move out of the way, the German readily slipped down in the direction of the door leading to the cab. 

The sudden crunch of the German's skull as it caved in under the crowbar made Artem and Bruzzhak jump as if touched by red-hot iron. The body of the soldier rolled limply into the passage leading to the cab. 

The blood seeped rapidly through the grey cloth forage cap and the rifle clattered against the iron side of the tender. 

"That's that," Polentovsky whispered as he dropped the crowbar. "No turning back for us now," he added, his face twitching convulsively. 

His voice broke, then rose to a shout to repel the silence that descended heavily on the three men. 

"Unscrew the throttle, quick!" he shouted. In ten minutes the job was done. The locomotive, now out of control, was slowly losing speed. 

The dark ponderous shapes of trees on the wayside lunged into the radius of light around the engine only to recede into the impenetrable gloom behind. In vain the engine's headlights sought to pierce the thick shroud of night for more than a dozen metres ahead, and gradually its stertorous breathing slowed down as if it had spent the last of its strength.

"Jump, son!" Artem heard Polentovsky's voice behind him and he let go of the handrail. The momentum of the train sent his powerful body hurtling forward until with a jolt his feet met the earth surging up from below. He ran for a pace or two and tumbled heavily head over heels.

Two other shadows left the engine simultaneously, one from each side of the cab.

Gloom had settled over the Bruzzhak house. Antonina Vasilievna, Sergei's mother, had eaten her heart out during the past four days. There had been no news from her husband; all she knew wasthat the Germans had forced him to man an engine together with Korchagin and Polentovsky. And yesterday three of the Hetman's guards had come around and questioned her in a rough, abusive manner.

From what they said she vaguely gathered that something had gone wrong and, gravely perturbed,she threw her kerchief over her head as soon as the men left and set out to see Maria Yakovlevna in the hope of learning some news of her husband.

Valya, her eldest daughter, who was tidying up the kitchen, noticed her slipping out of the house.

"Where're you off to, Mother?" the girl asked.

"To the Korchagins," Antonina Vasilievna replied, glancing at her daughter with eyes brimming with tears. "Perhaps they know something about father. If Sergei comes home tell him to go over to the station to see the Polentovskys."

Valya threw her arms around her mother's shoulders.

"Don't worry, Mum," she said as she saw her to the door.

As usual, Maria Yakovlevna gave Antonina Vasilievna a hearty welcome. Each had hoped that the other would have some news to tell, but the hope vanished as soon as they got talking.

The Korchagins' place had also been searched during the night. The soldiers had been looking for Artem, and had told Maria Yakovlevna on leaving to report to the Kommandantur as soon as her son returned.

The coming of the patrol had frightened Pavel's mother almost out of her wits. She had been homealone, for Pavel as usual was on the night shift at the power plant.

When Pavel returned from work early in the morning and heard from his mother about the search,he was much troubled. He feared for his brother's safety. Despite differences in character and Artem's seeming hardness, the two brothers were deeply attached to one another. It was a stern,undemonstrative affection, but Pavel knew that there was no sacrifice he would not make for his brother's sake,

Without stopping to rest, Pavel ran over to the station to look for Zhukhrai. He could not find him,and the other workers he knew could tell him nothing about the missing men. Engine driver Polentovsky's family too was completely in the dark; all he could learn from Polentovsky's youngest son, Boris, whom he met in the yard, was that their house too had been searched that night. The soldiers had been looking for his father.

Pavel came back to his mother with no news to report. Exhausted, he threw himself on the bed and dropped instantly into fitful slumber.

Valya looked up as the knock came at the door.

"Who's there?" she asked, unhooking the catch.

The dishevelled carroty head of Klimka Marchenko appeared in the open door. He had evidently been running, for he was out of breath and his face was red from exertion.

"Is your mother home?" he asked Valya.

"No, she's gone out."

"Where to?"

"To the Korchagins, I think." Valya seized hold of Klimka's sleeve as the boy was about to dash off.

Klimka looked up at the girl in hesitation.

"I've got to see her about something," he ventured.

"What is it?" Valya would not let him go. "Out with it, you red-headed bear you, and stop keeping me in suspense," she commanded.

Klimka forgot Zhukhrai's warnings and his strict instructions to deliver the note into Antonina Vasilievna's hands, and he pulled a soiled scrap of paper out of his pocket and handed it to the girl.

He could not refuse anything to Sergei's pretty fair-haired sister, for truth to tell he had a soft spot in his heart for her. He was far too timid, however, to admit it even to himself. The girl quickly read the slip of paper he had handed to her.

"Dear Tonya! Don't worry. All's well. They're safe and sound. Soon you will have more news. Let the others know that everything is all right so they needn't worry. Destroy this note. Zykhar"

Valya rushed over to Klimka.

"My dear little brown bear, where did you get this? Who gave it to you?" And she shook Klimka so violently that he quite lost his presence of mind and made his second blunder before he knew it.

"Zhukhrai gave it to me down at the station." Then, remembering that he should not have said it,

he added: "But he told me not to give it to anybody but your mother."

"That's all right," Valya laughed. "I won't tell anybody. Now you run along like a good little bear to Pavel's place and you'll find mother there." And she gave the lad a light push in the back.

A second later Klimka's red head disappeared through the garden gate.

None of the three railwaymen returned home. In the evening Zhukhrai came to the Korchagins and told Maria Yakovlevna what had happened on the train. He did his best to calm the fear-stricken mother, and assured her that all three were safe with Bruzzhak's uncle who lived in an out-of-theway village; they could not come back now, of course, but the Germans were in a tight fix and the situation was likely to change any day.

The disappearance of the three men brought their families closer together than ever. The rare notes that were received from them were read with rejoicing, but home seemed an empty and dreary place without them.

One day Zhukhrai dropped in to see Polentovsky's wife as if in passing, and gave her some money.

"Here's something from your husband to keep you going," he said. "Only see you don't mention it to anyone."

The old woman gratefully clasped his hand.

"Thanks. We need it badly. There's nothing to give the children to eat."

The money came from the fund left by Bulgakov.

"Well, now we'll see what comes next," said Zhukhrai to himself as he walked back to the station.

"Even if the strike's broken under the threat of shooting, even if the workers are back at the job,the fire has been kindled and it can't be put out any more. As for those three, they're stout fellows,true proletarians," 

In a little old smithy whose soot-blackened front faced the road in the outskirts of the village of Vorobyova Balka, Polentovsky stood before the glowing forge, his eyes narrowed from the glare, and turned over a red-hot piece of iron with a pair of long-handled tongs. 

Artem pumped the bellows suspended from a crossbeam overhead. 

"A skilled worker won't go under in the villages these days—there's as much work to be had as you might want," chuckling good-naturedly in his beard the engine driver said. "A week or two like this and we'll be able to send some fatback and flour home to the folks. The peasant always respects a smith, son. You'll see, we'll feed ourselves up like capitalists, ha-ha! Zakhar's a bit different from us—he hangs on to the peasantry, has his roots in the land through that uncle of his. 

Well, I can't say as I blame him. You and me, Artem, we've got neither harrow nor barrow, so to say, nought but a strong back and a pair of hands—what they call eternal proletarians, that's us— ha-ha—but old Zakhar's kind of split in two, one foot in the locomotive and the other in the village." He shifted the red-hot metal with the tongs and continued in a more serious vein: "As for us, son, things look bad. If the Germans aren't smashed pretty soon we'll have to get through to Yekaterinoslav or Rostov; otherwise we might find ourselves nabbed and strung up between heaven and earth before we know it." "You're right there," Artem mumbled. "I wish I knew how our people are getting on out there. Are the Haidamaks leaving them alone, I wonder." 

"Yes, pa, we're in a mess. We'll just have to give up thinking of going home." 

The engine driver pulled the hot piece of glowing blue metal from the forge and with a dexterous movement laid it on the anvil. 

"Lay on to it, son!" 

Artem seized the sledge-hammer, swung it high above his head and then brought it down on the anvil. A fountain of bright sparks spurted with a hiss in all directions, lighting up for a moment the darkest corners of the smithy. Polentovsky turned over the red-hot slab under the powerful blows and the iron obediently flattened out like so much soft wax. 

Through the open doors of the smithy came the warm breath of the dark night.

Down below lay the lake, dark and vast. The pines surrounding it on all sides nodded their lofty heads. 

"Like living things," thought Tonya looking up at them. She was lying in a grass-carpeted depression on the granite shore. High above her beyond the hollow the woods began, and below, at the very foot of the bluff, was the lake. The shadows of the cliffs pressing in on the lake gave the dark sheet of water a still darker fringe. 

This old stone quarry not far from the station was Tonya's favourite haunt. Springs had burst forth in the deep abandoned workings and now three lakes had formed there. The sound of splashing from where the shore dropped into the water caused Tonya to raise her head. Parting the branches in front of her, she looked in the direction of the sound. A supple, sun-tanned body was swimming away from the shore with strong strokes. Tonya caught sight of the swimmer's brown back and dark head; he snorted like a walrus, cut through the water with brisk strokes, somersaulted and dived, then turned over on his back and floated, squinting in the bright sun, his arms stretched out and his body slightly bent.

Tonya let the branch fall back into place. "It's not nice to look," she smiled to herself and returnedto her reading.

She was so engrossed in the book which Leszczinski had given her that she did not noticesomeone climb over the granite rocks that separated the hollow from the pine woods; only when apebble, inadvertently set into motion by the intruder, rolled onto the book did she look up with a start to see Pavel Korchagin standing before her. He too was taken aback by the encounter and in his confusion turned to go.

"It must have been him I saw in the water," Tonya thought as she noticed his wet hair.

"Did I frighten you? I didn't know you were here,"

Pavel laid his hand on the rocky ledge. He had recognised Tonya.

"You aren't interfering at all. You may stay and talk with me for a while if you like."

Pavel looked at Tonya in surprise.

"What could we talk about?"

Tonya smiled.

"Why don't you sit down—here, for instance?" She pointed to a stone. "What is your name?"

"Pavka Korchagin."

"My name's Tonya. So now we've introduced ourselves."

Pavel twisted his cap in embarrassment.

"So you're called Pavka?" Tonya broke the silence. "Why Pavka? It doesn't sound nice, Pavel would be ever so much better. That's what I shall call you—Pavel. Do you come here often. .. ."

She wanted to say "to swim", but not wishing to admit having seen him in the water, she said instead: "for a walk?"

"No, not often. Only when I've got time off," Pavel replied.

"So you work somewhere?" Tonya questioned him further.

"At the power plant. As a stoker."

"Tell me, where did you learn to fight so skilfully?" Tonya asked unexpectedly.

"What's my fighting to you?" Pavel blurted out in spite of himself.

"Now don't be angry, Korchagin," said Tonya hastily, seeing that her question had annoyed him.

"I'm just interested, that's all. What a punch that was! You shouldn't be so merciless." She burst out laughing.

"Sorry for him, eh?" Pavel asked.

"Not at all. On the contrary, Sukharko only got what he deserved. I enjoyed it immensely. I hear you get into scraps quite often."

"Who says so?" Pavel pricked up his ears.

"Well, Victor Leszczinski declares you're a professional scrapper."

Pavel's features darkened.

"Victor's a swine and a softy. He ought to be thankful he didn't get it then. I heard what he said about me, but I didn't want to muck up my hands."

"Don't use such language, Pavel. It's not nice," Tonya interrupted him.

Pavel bristled.

"Why did I have to start talking to this ninny?" he thought to himself. "Ordering me about like this: first it's 'Pavka' doesn't suit her and now she's finding fault with my language."

"What have you against Leszczinski?" Tonya asked.

"He's a sissy, a mama's boy without any guts! My fingers itch at the sight of his kind: always trying to walk all over you, thinks he can do anything he wants because he's rich. But I don't give a damn for his wealth. Just let him try to touch me and he'll get it good and proper. Fellows like that are only asking for a punch in the jaw," Pavel went on, roused.

Tonya regretted having mentioned Leszczinski. She could see that this young man had old scores to settle with the dandified schoolboy. To steer the conversation into more placid channels she began questioning Pavel about his family and work.

Before he knew it, Pavel was answering the girl's questions in great detail, forgetting that he had wanted to go.

"Why didn't you finish school?" Tonya asked.

"Got thrown out."

"Why?"

Pavel blushed.

"I put some tobacco in the priest's dough, and so they chucked me out. He was mean, that priest;he'd worry the life out of you." And Pavel told her the whole story.

Tonya listened with interest. Pavel got over his initial shyness and was soon talking to her as if she were an old acquaintance. Among other things he told her about his brother's disappearance.

Neither of the two noticed the hours pass as they sat there in the hollow engrossed in friendly conversation. At last Pavel sprang to his feet.

"It's time I was at work. I ought to be firing the boilers instead of sitting here gassing. Danilo is sure to raise a fuss now." Ill at ease once more he added: "Well, good-bye, miss. I've got to dash off to town now."

Tonya jumped up, pulling on her jacket.

"I must go too. Let's go together."

"Oh no, couldn't do that. I'll have to run."

"All right. I'll race you. Let's see who gets there first."

Pavel gave her a disdainful look. "Race me? You haven't a chance!"

"We'll see. Let's get out of here first." Pavel jumped over the ledge of stone, then extended a hand to Tonya, and the two trotted through the woods to the broad, level clearing leading to the station.

Tonya stopped in the middle of the road. "Now, let's go: one, two, three, go! Try and catch me!" She was off like a whirlwind down the track, the soles of her shoes flashing and the tail of her blue jacket flying in the wind. Pavel raced after her.

"I'll catch up with her in two shakes," thought Pavel as he sped after the flying jacket, but it was only at the end of the lane quite close to the station that he overtook her. Making a final spurt, he caught up with her and seized her shoulders with his strong hands.

"Tag! You're it!" he cried gaily, panting from the exertion.

"Don't! You're hurting me!" Tonya resisted. As they stood there panting, their pulses racing,Tonya, exhausted by the wild chase, leaned ever so lightly against Pavel in a fleeting moment of sweet intimacy that he was not soon to forget.

"Nobody has ever overtaken me before," she said as she drew away from him.

At this they parted and with a farewell wave of his cap Pavel ran toward town.

When Pavel pushed open the boiler-room door, Danilo, the stoker, was already busy firing the boiler.

"Couldn't you make it any later?" he growled. "Expect me to do your work for you?" Pavel patted his mate on the shoulder placatingly. "We'll have the fire going full blast in a jiffy, old man," he said cheerfully and applied himself to the firewood.

Toward midnight, when Danilo was snoring lustily on the woodpile, Pavel finished oiling the engine, wiped his hands on waste, pulled out the sixty-second instalment of Giuseppe Garibaldi from a toolbox, and was soon lost in the fascinating adventures of the Neapolitan "Redshirts' "

legendary leader.

"She gazed at the duke with her beautiful blue eyes. . . ."

"She's also got blue eyes," thought Pavel. "And she's different, not at all like rich folk. And she can run like the devil."

Engrossed in the memory of his encounter with Tonya during the day, Pavel did not hear the rising whine of the engine which was now straining under the pressure of excess steam; the huge flywheel whirled madly and a nervous tremor ran through the concrete mounting.

A glance at the pressure gauge showed Pavel that the needle was several points above the red warning line.

"Damn it!" Pavel leapt to the safety valve, gave it two quick turns, and the steam ejected through the exhaust pipe into the river hissed hoarsely outside the boiler room. Pulling a lever, Pavel threw the drive belt onto the pump pulley.

He glanced at Danilo, but the latter was fast asleep, his mouth wide open and his nose emitting fearful sounds.

Half a minute later the pressure gauge needle had returned to normal.

After parting with Pavel, Tonya headed for home, her thoughts occupied by her encounter with the dark-eyed lad; she felt happy, though she did not know why.

"What spirit he has, what grit! And he isn't at all the ruffian I imagined him to be. At any rate he's nothing like all those silly schoolboys. . . ."

Pavel was of another mould, he came from an environment to which Tonya was a stranger.

"But he can be tamed," she thought. "He'll be an interesting friend to have."

As she approached home, she saw Liza Sukharko and Nelly and Victor Leszczinski in the garden.

Victor was reading. They were obviously waiting for her.

They exchanged greetings and she sat down on a bench. In the midst of the empty small talk,Victor sat down beside her and asked:

"Have you read the novel I gave you?"

"Novel?" Tonya looked up. "Oh, I. . . ." She almost told him she had forgotten the book on the lakeshore.

"Did you like the love story?" Victor looked at her questioningly.

Tonya was lost in thought for a moment, then, slowly tracing an intricate pattern on the sand of the walk with the toe of her shoe, she raised her head and looked at Victor.

"No. I have begun a far more interesting love story." "Indeed?" Victor drawled, annoyed. "Who's the author?"

Tonya looked at him with shining, smiling eyes.

"There is no author. . . ."

"Tonya, ask your visitors in. Tea's served," Tonya's mother called from the balcony.

Taking the two girls by the arm, Tonya led the way to the house. As he followed them, Victor puzzled over her words, unable to guess their meaning.

This strange new feeling that had imperceptibly taken possession of him disturbed Pavel; he did not understand it and his rebellious spirit was troubled.

Tonya's father was the chief forest warden, which, as far as Pavel was concerned, put him in the same class as the lawyer Leszczinski.

Pavel had grown up in poverty and want, and he was hostile to anyone whom he considered to be well off. And so his feeling for Tonya was tinged with apprehension and misgiving; Tonya was not one of his own crowd, she was not simple and easy to understand like Galochka, the stonemason's daughter, for instance. With Tonya he was always on his guard, ready to rebuff any hint of the mockery or condescension he would expect a beautiful and cultivated girl like her to show towards a common stoker like himself.

He had not seen her for a whole week and today he decided to go down to the lake. He deliberately chose the road that took him past her house in the hope of meeting her. As he walked slowly past the fence, he caught sight of the familiar sailor blouse at the far end of the garden. He picked up a pine cone lying on the road, aimed it at the white blouse and let fly.

Tonya turned, saw him and ran over to the fence, stretching out her hand with a warm smile.

"You've come at last," she said and there was gladness in her voice. "Where have you been all this time? I went down to the lake to get the book I had left there. I thought you might be there. Won't you come in?"

Pavel shook his head.

"No."

"Why not?" Her eyebrows rose in surprise.

"Your father wouldn't like it, I bet. He'd likely give you hell for letting a ragamuffin like me into the garden."

"What nonsense, Pavel," Tonya said in anger. "Come inside at once. My father would never say anything of the kind. You'll see for yourself. Now come in."

She ran to open the gate for him and Pavel followed her uncertainly.

"Do you like books?" she asked him when they were seated at a round garden table.

"Very much," Pavel replied eagerly.

"What book do you like best of all?"

Pavel pondered the question for a few moments before replying: "Jeezeppy Garibaldi."

"Giuseppe Garibaldi," Tonya corrected him. "So you like that book particularly?"

"Yes. I've read all the sixty-eight instalments. I buy five of them every pay day. Garibaldi, that's a man for you!" Pavel exclaimed. "A real hero! That's what I call the real stuff. All those battles he had to fight and he always came out on top. And he travelled all over the world! If he was alive today I would join him, I swear I would. He used to take young workers into his band and they all fought together for the poor folk."

"Would you like me to show you our library?" Tonya said and took his arm.

"Oh no, I'm not going into the house," Pavel objected.

"Why are you so stubborn? What is there to be afraid of?"

Pavel glanced down at his bare feet which were none too clean, and scratched the back of his head.

"Are you sure your mother or your father won't throw me out?"

"If you don't stop saying such things I'll get really annoyed with you," Tonya flared up.

"Well, Leszczinski would never let the likes of us into his house, he always talks to us in the kitchen. I had to go there for something once and Nelly wouldn't even let me into the room—must have been afraid I'd spoil her carpets or something," Pavel said with a grin.

"Come on, come on," she urged him, taking him by the shoulder and giving him a friendly little push toward the porch.

She led him through the dining room into a room with a huge oak bookcase. And when she opened the doors Pavel beheld hundreds of books standing in neat rows. He had never seen such wealth in his life.

"Now we'll find an interesting book for you, and you must promise to come regularly for more.

Will you?"

Pavel nodded happily.

"I love books," he said.

They spent several pleasant hours together that day. She introduced him to her mother. It was not such a terrible ordeal after all. In fact he liked Tonya's mother.

Tonya took Pavel to her own room and showed him her own books.

On the dressing table stood a small mirror. Tonya led Pavel up to it and said with a little laugh:

"Why do you let your hair grow wild like that? Don't you ever cut it or comb it?"

"I just shave it clean off when it grows too long. What else should I do with it?" Pavel said,embarrassed.

Tonya laughed, and picking up a comb from the dressing table she ran it quickly a few times through his unruly locks.

"There, that's better," she said as she surveyed her handiwork. "Hair ought to be neatly cut, you shouldn't go around looking like an oaf."

She glanced critically at his faded brown shirt and his shabby trousers but made no further comment.

Pavel noticed the glance and felt ashamed of his clothes.

When they said good-bye, Tonya invited him to come again. She made him promise to come in two days' time and go fishing with her.

Pavel left the house by the simple expedient of jumping out of the window; he did not care to go through the other rooms and meet Tonya's mother again.

With Artem gone, things grew hard for the Korchagins. Pavel's wages did not suffice.

Maria Yakovlevna suggested to Pavel that she go out to work again, especially since the Leszczinskis happened to be in need of a cook. But Pavel was against it.

"No, mother, I'll find some extra work to do. They need men at the sawmill to stack the timber. I'll put in a half a day there and that'll give us enough to live on. You mustn't go to work, or Artem

will be angry with me for not being able to get along without that."

His mother tried to insist, but Pavel was adamant.

The next day Pavel was already working at the sawmill stacking up the freshly sawn boards to dry.

There he met several lads he knew, Misha Levchukov, an old schoolmate of his, and Vanya Kuleshov. Misha and he teamed together and working at piece rates they earned quite well. Pavel spent his days at the sawmill and in the evenings went to his job at the power plant.

On the evening of the tenth day Pavel brought his earnings to his mother.

As he handed her the money, he fidgeted uneasily, blushed and said finally:

"You know what, mother, buy me a sateen shirt, a blue one—like the one I had last year,remember? It'll take about half the money, but don't worry, I'll earn some more. This shirt of mine is pretty shabby," he added, as if apologising far his request.

"Why, of course I'll buy it for you," said his mother, "I'll get the material today, Pavlusha, and tomorrow I'll sew it. You really do need a new shirt." And she gazed tenderly at her son.

Pavel paused at the entrance to the barbershop and fingering the ruble in his pocket turned into the doorway.

The barber, a smart-looking young man, noticed him entering and signed toward the empty chair with his head.

"Next, please."

As he settled into the deep, soft chair, Pavel saw in the mirror before him a flustered, confused face.

"Clip it close?" the barber asked.

"Yes, that is, no—well, what I want is a haircut—how do you call it?" Pavel floundered, making a despairing gesture with his hand.

"I understand," the barber smiled.

A quarter of an hour later Pavel emerged, perspiring and exhausted by the ordeal, but with his hair neatly trimmed and combed. The barber had worked hard at the unruly mop, but water and the comb had won out in the end and the bristling tufts now lay neatly in place.

Out in the street Pavel heaved a sigh of relief and pulled his cap down over his eyes.

"I wonder what mother'll say when she sees me?" he thought.

Tonya was vexed when Pavel did not keep his promise to go fishing with her.

"That stoker boy isn't very considerate," she thought with annoyance, but when several more days passed and Pavel failed to appear she began to long for his company.

One day as she was about to go out for a walk, her mother looked into her room and said:

"A visitor to see you, Tonya. May he come in?"

Pavel appeared in the doorway, changed so much that Tonya barely recognised him at first.

He was wearing a brand-new blue sateen shirt and dark trousers. His boots had been polished until they shone, and, as Tonya noted at once, his bristly mop had been trimmed. The grimy young stoker was transformed.

Tonya was about to express her surprise, but checked herself in time for she did not want to embarrass the lad, who was uncomfortable enough as it was. So she pretended not to have noticed the striking change in his appearance and began scolding him instead.

"Why didn't you come fishing? You should be ashamed of yourself! Is that how you keep your promises?"

"I've been working at the sawmill these days and just couldn't get away."

He could not tell her that he had been working the last few days to the point of exhaustion in order to buy himself the shirt and trousers.

Tonya, however, guessed the truth herself and her annoyance with Pavel vanished.

"Let's go for a walk down to the pond," she suggested, and they went out through the garden onto the road.

Before long Pavel was telling Tonya about the revolver he had stolen from the Lieutenant, sharing his big secret with her as with a friend, and promising her that some day very soon they would go deep into the woods to do some shooting.

"But see that you don't give me away," Pavel said abruptly.

"I shall never give you away," Tonya vowed.

冬妮亚站在敞开的窗户前，闷闷不乐地望着熟悉而亲切的花园，望着花园四周那些挺拔的、在微风中轻轻摇曳的白杨。她简直不敢相信，离开自己的家园已经整整一年了。她仿佛昨天才离开这个童年时代就熟悉的地方，今天又乘早车返了回来。

这里什么都没有变样：依然是一排排修剪得整整齐齐的树莓，依然是按几何图形布局的小径，两旁种着妈妈喜爱的蝴蝶花。花园里的一切都是那样干净利落。处处都显示出一个学究式的林学家的匠心。但是这些干净的、图案似的小径却使冬妮亚感到乏味。

冬妮亚拿了一本没有读完的小说，打开通外廊的门，下了台阶，走进花园。她又推开油漆的小栅栏门，缓步朝车站水塔旁边的池塘走去。

她走过一座小桥，上了大路。这条路很像公园里的林荫道。右边是池塘，池塘周围长着垂柳和茂密的柳丛。左边是一片树林。

她刚想朝池塘附近的旧采石场走去，忽然看见下面池塘岸边扬起一根钓竿，于是就停住了脚步。

她从一棵弯曲的柳树上面探过身去，用手拨开柳丛的枝条，看到下面有一个晒得黝黑的男孩子。他光着脚，裤腿一直卷到大腿上，身旁放着一只盛蚯蚓的锈铁罐子。那少年正在聚精会神地钓鱼，没有发觉冬妮亚在注视他。

“这儿难道能钓着鱼吗？”

保尔生气地回头看了一眼。

他看见一个陌生的姑娘站在那里，手扶着柳树，身子探向水面。她穿着领子上有蓝条的白色水兵服和浅灰色短裙。一双带花边的短袜紧紧裹住晒黑了的匀称的小腿，脚上穿着棕色的便鞋。栗色的头发梳成一条粗大的辫子。

拿钓竿的手轻轻颤动了一下，鹅毛鱼漂点了点头，在平静的水面上荡起了一圈圈波纹。

背后随即响起了她那焦急的声音：“咬钩了，瞧，咬钩了……”

保尔慌了手脚，急忙拉起钓竿。钩上的蚯蚓打着转转，蹦出水面，带起一朵水花。

“这回还能钓个屁！真是活见鬼，跑来这么个人。”保尔恼火地想。为了掩饰自己的笨拙，他把钓钩甩到更远的水里。

钓钩落在两支牛蒡的中间，这里恰恰是不应当下钓的地方，因为鱼钩可能挂到牛蒡根上。

保尔情知钓下错了地方，他头也不回，低声埋怨起背后的姑娘来：“你瞎嚷嚷什么，把鱼都吓跑了。”

他立刻听到上面传来几句连嘲笑带挖苦的答话：“单是您这副模样，也早就把鱼吓跑了。再说，大白天能钓着鱼吗？瞧您这个渔夫，多能干！”

保尔竭力保持礼貌，可是对方未免太过分了。他站起身来，把帽子扯到前额上——这向来是他生气的表示——尽量挑选最客气的字眼，说：“小姐，您还是靠边呆着去，好不好？”

冬妮亚眯起眼睛，微微一笑，说：“难道我妨碍您吗？”

她的声音里已经没有嘲笑的味道，而是一种友好与和解的口吻了。保尔本来想对这位不知从哪里冒出来的“小姐”发作一通，现在却被解除了武装。

“也没什么，您要是愿意看，就看好了，我并不是舍不得地方给您坐。”说完，他坐了下来，重新看他的鱼漂。鱼漂紧贴着牛蒡不动，显然是鱼钩挂在根上了。保尔不敢起钓，心里嘀咕着：“钩要是挂上，就摘不下来了。这位肯定要笑话我。她要是走掉该多好！”

然而，冬妮亚却在一棵微微摇摆的弯曲的柳树上，坐得更舒适了。她把书放在膝盖上，看着这个晒得黝黑的、黑眼睛的孩子，他先是那样不客气地对待她，现在又故意不理睬她，真是个粗野的家伙。

保尔从镜子一样的水面上清楚地看到了那姑娘的倒影。

她正坐着看书，于是他悄悄地往外拉那挂住的钓丝。鱼漂在下沉，钓丝绷得紧紧的。

“真挂住了，该死的！”他心里想，一斜眼，看见水中有一张顽皮的笑脸。

水塔旁边的小桥上，有两个年轻人正朝这边走来，他们都是文科学校七年级学生。一个是机车库主任苏哈里科工程师的儿子。他是个愚蠢而又爱惹是生非的家伙，今年十七岁，浅黄头发，一脸雀斑，同学们给他起了个绰号，叫麻子舒拉。

他手里拿着一副上好的钓竿，神气活现地叼着一支香烟。和他并排走着的是维克托，一个身材匀称的娇气十足的青年。

苏哈里科侧过身子，朝维克托挤眉弄眼地说：“这个姑娘像葡萄干一样香甜，别有风味。这样的，本地再也找不出第二个。我担保她是个浪——漫——女——郎。她在基辅上学，读六年级。现在是到父亲这儿来消夏的。她父亲是本地的林务官。她跟我妹妹莉莎很熟。我给她写过一封情书，你知道，满篇都是动人的词句。我说我发狂地爱着她。战栗地期待着她的回信。我甚至选了纳德森［纳德森（１８６２—１８８７），俄国诗人。——译者］的一首诗，抄了进去。”

“结果怎么样？”维克托兴致勃勃地问。

苏哈里科有点狼狈，说：“你知道，还不是装腔作势，摆臭架子……说什么别糟蹋信纸了。不过，这种事情开头总是这一套。干这一行，我可是个老手。你知道，我才不愿意没完没了地跟在屁股后面献殷勤。晚上到工棚那儿去，花上三个卢布，就能弄到一个让你见了流口水的美人，比这要好多了。而且人家一点也不扭扭捏捏。你认得铁路上的那个工头瓦利卡·季洪诺夫吗？我们俩就去过。”

维克托轻蔑地皱起眉头，说：“舒拉，你还干这种下流勾当？”

舒拉·苏哈里科咬了咬纸烟，吐了一口唾沫，讥笑地说：“你倒像个一尘不染的正人君子，其实你干的事，我们全知道。”

维克托打断他的话，问：“那么，你能把她介绍给我吗？”

“当然可以，趁她还没走，咱们快点去。昨天早上，她自己也在这儿钓鱼来着。”

两个朋友已经到了冬妮亚跟前。苏哈里科取出嘴里的纸烟，挺有派头地鞠了一躬。

“您好，图曼诺娃小姐。怎么，您在钓鱼吗？”

“不，我在看别人钓鱼。”冬妮亚回答。

苏哈里科急忙拉着维克托的手，说：“你们两位还不认识吧？这位是我的朋友维克托·列辛斯基。”

维克托不自然地把手伸给冬妮亚。

“今天您怎么没钓鱼呢？”苏哈里科竭力想引起话头来。

“我没带钓竿。”冬妮亚回答。

“我马上再去拿一副来。”苏哈里科连忙说。“请您先用我的钓吧，我这就去拿。”

他履行了对维克托许下的诺言，介绍他跟冬妮亚认识之后，现在要设法走开，好让他们俩在一起。

“不，咱们这样会打搅别人的，这儿已经有人在钓鱼了。”冬妮亚说。

“打搅谁？”苏哈里科问。“啊，是这个小子吗？”他这时才看见坐在柳丛前面的保尔。“好办，我马上叫这小子滚蛋！”

冬妮亚还没有来得及阻止他，他已经走下坡去，到了正在钓鱼的保尔跟前。

“赶紧给我把钓竿收起来，滚蛋。”苏哈里科对保尔喊。他看见保尔还在稳稳当当地坐着钓鱼，又喊：“听见没有，快点，快点！”

保尔抬起头，毫不示弱地白了苏哈里科一眼。

“你小点声，龇牙咧嘴地嚷嚷什么？”

“什——什——么？”苏哈里科动了肝火。“你这穷光蛋，竟敢回嘴。给我滚开！”说着，狠劲朝盛蚯蚓的铁罐子踢了一脚。铁罐子在空中翻了几翻，扑通一声掉进水里，激起的水星溅到冬妮亚的脸上。

“苏哈里科，您怎么不害臊啊！”她喊了一声。

保尔跳了起来。他知道苏哈里科是机车库主任的儿子，阿尔焦姆就在他父亲手下干活。要是现在就对准这张虚胖焦黄的丑脸揍他一顿，他准要向他父亲告状，那样就一定会牵连到阿尔焦姆。正是因为这一点，保尔才克制着自己，没有立即惩罚他。

苏哈里科却以为保尔要动手打他，便扑了过去，用双手去推站在水边的保尔。保尔两手一扬，身子一晃，但是稳住了，没有跌下水去。

苏哈里科比保尔大两岁，要讲打架斗殴，惹是生非，他是第一把交椅。

保尔胸口挨了这一下，忍无可忍了。

“啊，你真动手？好吧，瞧我的！”说着，把手稍稍一扬，照苏哈里科的脸狠狠打了一拳。紧接着，没容他还手，一把紧紧抓住他的学生装，猛劲一拉，把他拖到了水里。

苏哈里科站在没膝深的水中，锃亮的皮鞋和裤子全都湿了。他拼命想挣脱保尔那铁钳般的手。保尔把他拖下水以后，就跳上岸来。

狂怒的苏哈里科跟着朝保尔扑过来，恨不得一下子把他撕碎。

保尔上岸以后，迅速转过身来，面对着扑过来的苏哈里科。这时他想起了拳击要领：“左腿支住全身，右腿运劲、微屈，不单用手臂，而且要用全身力气，从下往上，打对手的下巴。”他按照要领狠劲打了一下……

只听得两排牙齿喀哒一声撞在一起。苏哈里科感到下巴一阵剧烈疼痛，舌头也咬破了，他尖叫一声，双手在空中乱舞了几下，整个身子向后一仰，扑通一声，笨重地倒在水里。

冬妮亚在岸上忍不住哈哈大笑起来。“打得好，打得好！”她拍着手喊。“真有两下子！”

保尔抓住钓竿，使劲一拽，拉断了挂住的钓丝，跑到大路上去了。

临走的时候，他听到维克托对冬妮亚说：“这家伙是个头号流氓，叫保尔·柯察金。”

车站上变得不安宁了。从铁路沿线传来消息说，铁路工人已经开始罢工。邻近的一个火车站上

Part One Chapter 4
---

A fierce and merciless class struggle gripped the Ukraine. More and more people took to arms and each clash brought forth new fighters.

Gone were the days of peace and tranquillity for the respectable citizen.

The little tumbledown houses shook in the storm blasts of gun salvos, and the respectable citizen huddled against the walls of his cellar or took cover in his backyard trench.

An avalanche of Petlyura bands of all shades and hues overran the gubernia, led by little chieftains and big ones, all manner of Golubs, Archangels, Angels and Gordiuses and a host of other bandits.

Ex-officers of the tsarist army, Right and Left Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionaries—any desperado who could muster a band of cutthroats, declared himself Ataman, and some raised the yellow-and-blue Petlyura flag and established their authority over whatever area was within the scope of their strength and opportunities.

Out of these heterogeneous bands reinforced by kulaks and the Galician regiments of Ataman Konovalets' siege corps, "Chief Ataman" Petlyura formed his regiments and divisions. And when Red partisan detachments struck at this Socialist-Revolutionary and kulak rabble the very earth trembled under the pounding of hundreds and thousands of hoofs and the rumble of the wheels of machine-gun carts and gun carriages.

In April of that turbulent 1919, the respectable citizen, dazed and terrified, would open his shutters of a morning and, peering out with sleep-heavy eyes, greet his next-door neighbour with the anxious question:

"Avtonom Petrovich, do you happen to know who's in power today?"

And Avtonom Petrovich would hitch up his trousers and cast a frightened look around.

"Can't say, Afanas Kirillovich. Somebody did enter the town during the night. Who it was we'll find out soon enough; if they start robbing the Jews, we'll know they're Petlyura men, and if they're some of the 'comrades', we'll be able to tell at once by the way they talk. I'm keeping an eye open myself so's to know what portrait to hang up. Wouldn't care to get into trouble like Gerasim Leontievich next door. You see, he didn't look out properly and had just gone and hung up a picture of Lenin when three men rushed in—Petlyura men as it turned out. They took one look at the picture and jumped on him—a good twenty strokes they gave him. 'We'll skin you alive, you Communist sonofabitch,' they shouted. And no matter how hard he tried to explain and 

how loud he yelled, nothing helped." 

Noting groups of armed men coming down the street the respectable citizen closed his windows and went into hiding. Better to be on the safe side. . . . 

As for the workers, they regarded the yellow-and-blue flags of the Petlyura thugs with suppressed hatred. They were powerless in the face of this wave of Ukrainian bourgeois chauvinism, and their spirits rose only when passing Red units, fighting fiercely against the yellow-and-blues that were bearing down on them from all sides, wedged their way into the town. For a day or two the flag so dear to the worker's heart would fly over the town hall, but then the unit would move on again and the engulfing gloom return. 

Now the town was in the hands of Colonel Golub, the "hope and pride" of the Transdnieper Division. 

His band of two thousand cutthroats had made a triumphal entry into the town the day before. Pan the Colonel had ridden at the head of the column on a splendid black stallion. In spite of the warm April sun he wore a Caucasian burka, a lambskin Zaporozhye Cossack cap with a raspberry-red crown, a cherkesska, and the weapons that went with the outfit: dagger and sabre with chased-silver hilts. Between his teeth he held a pipe with a curved stem. 

A handsome fellow, Pan the Colonel Golub, with his black eyebrows and pallid complexion tinged slightly green from incessant carousals! 

Before the revolution Pan the Colonel had been an agronomist at the beet plantations of a sugar refinery, but that was a dull life not to be compared with the position of an Ataman, and so on the crest of the murky waves that swept the land the agronomist emerged as Pan the Colonel Golub. 

In the only theatre in town a gala affair was got up in honour of the new arrivals. The "flower" of the Petlyura intelligentsia was there in full force: Ukrainian teachers, the priest's two daughters, the beautiful Anya and her younger sister Dina, some ladies of lesser standing, former members of 

the household of Count Potocki, a few members of the middle class, remnants of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionaries, who called themselves "free Cossacks". The theatre was packed. Spur-clicking officers who might have been copied from old paintings of Zaporozhye Cossacks pranced around the teachers, the priest's daughters and the burghers' ladies who were decked out in Ukrainian national costumes ornamented with bright-coloured 

embroidered flowers and multihued beads and ribbons. 

The regimental band blared. On the stage feverish preparations were under way for the performance of Nazar Stodolya scheduled for the evening. 

There was no electricity, however, and the fact was reported in due course to Pan the Colonel at headquarters by his adjutant, Sublieutenant Polyantsev, who had now Ukrainianised his name and rank and styled himself Khorunzhy Palyanytsya. The Colonel, who intended to grace the evening with his presence, heard out Palyanytsya and said casually but imperiously: 

"See that there is light. Find an electrician and start the electric power plant if you have to break your neck doing it." 

"Very good, Pan Colonel." 

Khorunzhy Palyanytsya found electricians without breaking his neck. Within two hours Pavel and two other workers were brought to the power plant by armed guards. 

"If you don't have the lights on by seven I'll have all three of you strung up," Palyanytsya told them curtly, pointing to an iron beam overhead.

This blunt exposition of the situation had its effect and the lights came on at the appointed time.

The evening was in full swing when Pan the Colonel arrived with his lady, the buxom yellow-haired daughter of the barkeeper in whose house he was staying. Her father being a man of means,she had been educated at the Gymnasium in the gubernia town.

When the two had taken the seats reserved for them as guests of honour in the front row, Pan the Colonel gave the signal and the curtain rose so suddenly that the audience had a glimpse of the stage director's back as he hurried off the stage.

During the play the officers and their ladies whiled away the time at the refreshment counter,filling up on raw homebrew supplied by the ubiquitous Palyanytsya and delicacies acquired by requisitioning. By the end of the performance they were all well under the weather.

After the final curtain Palyanytsya leaped on the stage "Ladies and gentlemen, the dancing is about to begin," he announced with a theatrical sweep of

his arm.

There was general applause and the audience emptied out into the yard to give the Petlyura soldiers posted to guard the guests a chance to carry out the chairs and clear the dance floor.

A half an hour later the theatre was the scene of wild revelry.

The Petlyura officers, flinging all restraint to the winds, furiously danced the hopak with local belles flushed from the heat, and the pounding of heavy boots rocked the walls of the ramshackle theatre building.

In the meantime a troop of armed horsemen was approaching the town from the direction of the flour mill. A Petlyura sentry-post stationed at the town limits sprang in alarm to their machine guns and there was a clicking of breech-blocks in the night. Through the darkness came the sharp challenge:

"Halt! Who goes there?"

Two dark figures loomed out of the darkness. One of them stepped forward and roared out in a hoarse bass:

"Ataman Pavlyuk with his detachment. Who are you? Golub's men?"

"That's right," replied an officer who had also stepped forward.

"Where can I billet my men?" Pavlyuk asked.

"I'll phone headquarters at once," replied the officer and disappeared into a tiny hut on the roadside.

A minute later he came out and began issuing orders:

"Clear the machine gun off the road, men! Let the Pan Ataman pass."

Pavlyuk reined in his horse in front of the brightly illuminated theatre where a great many people were strolling out in the open air.

"Some fun going on here by the look of it," he said, turning to the captain riding beside him. "Let's dismount, Gukmach, and join the merrymaking. We'll pick ourselves a couple of women—I see the place is thick with them. Hey, Stalezhko," he shouted. "You billet the lads with the townsfolk.

We'll stop here. Escort, follow me." And he heaved himself heavily from his staggering mount.

At the entrance to the theatre Pavlyuk was stopped by two armed Petlyura men.

"Tickets?"

Pavlyuk gave them a derisive look and pushed one of them aside with his shoulder. The dozen men with him followed suit. Their horses were outside, tethered to the fence.

The newcomers were noticed at once. Particularly conspicuous was the huge frame of Pavlyuk; he was wearing an officer's coat of good cloth, blue breeches of the kind worn in the guards, and a shaggy fur cap. A Mauser hung from a strap slung over his shoulder and a hand grenade stuck out

of his pocket.

"Who's that?" the whisper passed through the crowd around the dance floor where Golub's second in command was executing a wild dance.

His partner was the priest's elder daughter, ^ who was whirling round with such abandon that her skirts flared out high enough to give the delighted men a good view of her silk petticoats.

Forcing his way through the crowd, Pavlyuk went right out onto the dance floor.

Pavlyuk stared with glazed eyes at the priest's daughter's legs, passed his tongue over his dry lips,then strode across the dance floor to the orchestra platform, stopped, and flicked his plaited ridingwhip.

"Come on, give us the hopak!"

The conductor paid no attention to the order.

A sharp movement of Pavlyuk's hand and the whip cut down the conductor's back. The latter jumped as if stung and the music broke off, plunging the hall into silence.

"What insolence!" The barkeeper's daughter was furious. "You can't let him do that," she cried,clutching at the elbow of Golub seated at her side.

Golub heaved himself to his feet, kicked aside a chair, took three paces forward and stopped faceto face with Pavlyuk. He had recognised the newcomer at once, and he had scores to settle with this rival claimant for local power. Only a week ago Pavlyuk had played the most scurvy trick on Pan the Colonel. At the height of a battle with a Red regiment which had mauled Golub's detachment on more than one occasion, Pavlyuk, instead of striking at the Bolsheviks from the rear, had broken into a town, overcome the resistance of the small pickets the Reds had left there,and, leaving a screening force to protect himself, sacked the place in the most thorough fashion.

Of course, being a true Petlyura man, he saw to it that the Jewish population were the chief victims. In the meantime the Reds had smashed up Golub's right flank and moved on.

And now this arrogant cavalry Captain had burst in here and had the audacity to strike Pan the Colonel's own bandmaster under his very eyes. No, this was too much. Golub knew that if he did not put the conceited upstart in his place his prestige in the regiment would be gone.

For several seconds the two men stood there in silence glaring at each other.

Gripping the hilt of his sabre with one hand and feeling for the revolver in his pocket with the other, Golub rapped out:

"How dare you lay your hands on my men, you scoundrel!"

Pavlyuk's hand crept toward the grip of the Mauser.

"Easy there, Pan Golub, easy, or you may trip yourself up. Don't step on my pet corn. I'm liable to lose my temper."

This was more than Golub could stand.

"Throw them out and give them twenty-five lashes each!" he shouted.

The officers fell upon Pavlyuk and his men like a pack of hounds.

A shot crashed out with a report that sounded as if an electric bulb had been smashed against the floor, and the struggling men swirled and spun down the hall like two packs of fighting dogs. In the wild melee men slashed at each other with sabres and dug their fingers into hair and throats,while the women, squealing with terror like stuck pigs, scattered away from the contestants.

In a few minutes Pavlyuk and his followers, disarmed and beaten, were dragged out of the hall,and thrown out into the street.

Pavlyuk lost his fur hat in the scrimmage, his face was bruised and his weapons were gone and now he was beside himself with rage. He and his men leapt into the saddle and galloped down the street.

The evening was broken up. No one felt inclined to make merry after what had happened. The women refused to dance and insisted on being taken home, but Golub would not hear of it.

"Post sentries," he ordered. "Nobody is to leave the hall."

Palyanytsya hastened to carry out the orders.

"The dancing will continue until morning, ladies and gentlemen," Golub replied stubbornly to the protests that showered upon him. "I shall dance the first waltz myself."

The orchestra struck up again but there was to be no more frolicking that night nevertheless.

The Colonel had not circled the dance floor once with the priest's daughter when the sentries ran into the hall shouting:

"Pavlyuk's surrounding the theatre!"

At that moment a window facing the street crashed in and the snub-nosed muzzle of a machine gun was pushed in through the shattered window frame. It moved stupidly this way and that, as if picking out the figures scattering wildly away from it toward the centre of the hall as from the devil himself.

Palyanytsya fired at the thousand-candle-power lamp in the ceiling which exploded like a bomb,sending a shower of splintered glass down on everyone in the hall.

The hall was plunged in darkness. Someone shouted in the yard:

"Everybody get outside!" A stream of violent abuse followed.

The wild, hysterical screams of the women, the furious commands issued by Golub as he dashed about the hall trying to rally his officers who had completely lost their heads, the firing and shouting out in the yard all merged into an indescribable pandemonium. In the panic nobody noticed Palyanytsya slip through the back door into a deserted side street and run for all he was worth to Golub's headquarters.

A half an hour later a full-dress battle was raging in the town. The silence of the night wasshattered by the incessant cracking of rifle fire interspersed with the rattle of machine guns.

Completely stupefied, the townsfolk leapt up from warm beds and pressed against window panes.

At last the firing abated, and only one machine gun somewhere in the outskirts kept up a desultory shooting like the barking of a dog.

The fighting died down as the glimmer of dawn appeared on the horizon. . . .

Rumours that a pogrom was brewing crept through the town, finally reaching the tiny, low-roofedewish cottages with crooked windows that somehow managed to cling to the top of the filthy ravine leading down to the river. In these incredibly overcrowded hovels called houses lived the Jewish poor.

The compositors and other workers at the printshop where Sergei Bruzzhak had been working for more than a year were Jews. Strong bonds of friendship had sprung up between them and Sergei.

Like a closely knit family, they stood solid against their employer, the smug, well-fed Mr.Blumstein. An incessant struggle went on between the proprietor and the printers. Blumstein did his best to grab more and pay his workers less. The printers had gone on strike several times and the printshop had stood idle for two or three weeks running. There were fourteen of them. Sergei,the youngest, spent twelve hours a day turning the wheel of a hand press.

Today Sergei noticed an ominous uneasiness among the workers. For the past several troubledmonths the shop had had little to do apart from printing occasional proclamations issued by the "Chief Ataman".

A consumptive compositor named Mendel called Sergei into a corner.

"Do you know there's a pogrom coming?" he said, looking at the boy with his sad eyes.

Sergei looked up in surprise.

"No, I hadn't the slightest idea."

Mendel laid a withered, yellow hand on Sergei's shoulder and spoke in a confiding, paternal tone.

"There's going to be a pogrom—that's a fact. The Jews are going to be beaten up. What I want to know is this—will you help your comrades in their misfortune or not?"

"Of course I will, if I only can. What can I do, Mendel?"

The compositors were now listening to the conversation.

"You're a good boy, Seryozha, and we trust you. After all, your father's a worker like us. Now you run home and ask him whether he would agree to hide some old men and women at his place, and then we'll decide who they will be. Ask your people if there's anyone else they know willing to do

the same. The Russians will be safe from these bandits for the time being. Run along, Seryozha,there's no time to waste."

"You can count on me, Mendel. I'll see Pavka and Klimka right away—their folks are sure to take in somebody."

"Just a minute," Mendel anxiously halted Sergei who was about to leave. "Who are Pavka and Klimka? Do you know them well?"

Sergei nodded confidently.

"Of course. They're my pals. Pavka Korchagin's brother is a mechanic."

"Ah, Korchagin," Mendel was reassured. "I know him —used to live in the same house. Yes, you can see the Korchagins. Go, Seryozha, and bring back an answer as soon as you can."

Sergei shot out into the street.

The pogrom began on the third day after the pitched battle between the Pavlyuk detachment and Golub's men.

Pavlyuk, routed and driven out of Shepetovka, had cleared out of the neighbourhood and seized a small town nearby. The night encounter in Shepetovka had cost him a score of men. Golub had lost as many.

The dead were hastily carted off to the cemetery and buried the same day without much ceremony,for there was nothing to boast about in the whole affair. The two Atamans had flown at each other's throats like two stray curs, and to make a fuss over the funeral would have been unseemly.

True, Palyanytsya had wanted to make a big thing of it and declare Pavlyuk a Red bandit, but the Socialist-Revolutionaries headed by the priest Vasili objected. 

The skirmish evoked some grumbling in Golub's regiment, especially among his bodyguard which had sustained the heaviest losses, and to put an end to the dissatisfaction and bolster up spirits, Palyanytsya proposed staging a pogrom—to provide "a little diversion" for the men, was the cynical way he broached the subject to Golub. He argued that this was essential in view of the grumbling in the unit. And although the Colonel was loth to disturb the peace in the town on the eve of his marriage to the barkeeper's daughter, he finally gave in. 

Pan the Colonel had another reason for objecting to the operation: his recent admission into the S.R. Party. His enemies might stir up trouble again by branding him a pogrom-monger, and without doubt would slander him to the "Chief Ataman". So far, however, Golub was not greatly dependent on the "Chief", since he foraged for himself. Besides, the "Chief" knew very well what riffraff he had serving under him, and himself had time and again demanded money for the Directory's needs from the so-called requisitions; as for the reputation of a pogrom-monger, Golub already had quite a record in that respect. There was very little that he could add to it now. 

The pogrom began early in the morning. 

The town was still wrapped in the grey mist of dawn. The narrow streets which wound themselves like strips of wet linen around the haphazardly built blocks of the Jewish quarter were deserted and dead. The windows were heavily curtained and shuttered. 

Outwardly the quarter appeared to be immersed in sound early-morning slumber, but inside the houses there was no sleep. Entire families, fully dressed, huddled together in one room, preparing themselves for the impending disaster. Only children, too young to realise what was happening, slept peacefully in their mothers' arms. 

Salomyga, the chief of Golub's bodyguard, a dark fellow with the swarthy complexion of a Gypsy and a livid sabre scar across his cheek, worked hard that morning to wake up Golub's aide. It was a painful awakening for Palyanytsya—he could not shake himself loose from the nightmare that had beset him all night; the grimacing, hunchbacked devil was still clawing at his throat. At last he raised his splitting head and saw Salomyga bending over him. 

"Get up, you souse," Salomyga was shaking him by the shoulder. "It's high time to get down to business!" 

Palyanytsya, now wide awake, sat up and, his face grimacing with pain, spat out the bitter saliva that filled his mouth. 

"What business?" he stared blankly at Salomyga. 

"To rip up the sheenies, of course! You haven't forgotten, I hope." 

It all came back to Palyanytsya. True enough, he had forgotten about it. The drinking bout at the farm where Pan the Colonel had retired with his fiancée and a handful of boon companions had been a heavy one. 

Golub had found it convenient to leave town for the duration of the pogrom, for afterwards he could put it down to a misunderstanding in his absence, and in the meantime Palyanytsya would have ample opportunity to make a thorough job of it. Yes, Palyanytsya was an expert when it came to providing "diversion"! Palyanytsya poured a pail of water over his head and, thus sobered, was soon striding about headquarters issuing orders. 

The bodyguard hundred was already in the saddle. To avoid possible complications, the farsighted Palyanytsya ordered pickets posted between the town proper and the workers' quarters and the

station. A machine gun was mounted in the Leszczinski garden facing the road in order to meet the workers with a squall of lead if they took it into their heads to interfere.

When all the preparations were complete, the aide and Salomyga leapt into the saddle.

"Wait, I nearly forgot," Palyanytsya said when they had already set out. "Get two carts to bring back Golub's wedding present. Ha-ha-ha! The first spoils as always to the commander, and the first girl for his aide—and that's me. Got it, you blockhead?"

The last remark was addressed to Salomyga, who glared back at him with jaundiced eyes.

"There'll be enough for everybody."

They spurred their horses down the highway, the aide and Salomyga leading the disorderly mob of mounted men.

The mist had lifted when Palyanytsya reined in his horse in front of a two-storey house with a rusty sign reading "Fuchs, Draper".

His thin-shanked grey mare nervously stamped her hoof against the cobblestones.

"Well, with God's help we'll begin here," Palyanytsya said as he jumped to the ground.

"All right, men, dismount," he turned to the men crowding around him. "The show's beginning.

Now I don't want any heads bashed, there'll be a time for that. As for the girls, if you can manage it, hold out until evening."

One of the men bared his strong teeth and protested:

"Now then, Pan Khorunzhy, what if it's by mutual consent?"

There was loud guffawing all around. Palyanytsya eyed the man who had spoken with admiring approbation.

"Well, that's another story—if they're willing, go right ahead, nobody can prohibit that."

Palyanytsya went up to the closed door of the store and kicked at it hard, but the sturdy oaken planks did not so much as tremble.

This was clearly the wrong place to begin. Palyanytsya rounded the corner of the house and headed for the door leading to Fuchs' place, supporting his sabre with his hand as he went.

Salomyga followed.

The people inside the house had heard the clatter of hoofs on the pavement outside and when the sound ceased in front of the shop and the men's voices carried through the walls their hearts

seemed to stop beating and their bodies stiffened with fright.

The wealthy Fuchs had left town the day before with his wife and daughters, leaving his servant Riva, a gentle timid girl of nineteen, to look after his property. Since she was afraid to remain alone in the house, he had suggested that she bring her old father and mother to stay with her until his return.

When Riva had tried meekly to protest, the cunning merchant had assured her that in all probability there would be no pogrom at all, for what could they expect to get from beggars? And he promised to give her a piece of stuff for a dress when he returned.

Now the three waited in fear and trembling, hoping against hope that the men would ride past;perhaps they had been mistaken, perhaps it had only seemed that the horses had stopped in front of their house. But their hopes were dashed by the dull reverberation of a blow at the shop door.

Old, silvery-haired Peisakh stood in the doorway, his blue eyes wide open like a frightened child's,and he whispered a prayer to Almighty Jehovah with all the passion of the fanatical believer. He prayed to God to protect this house from misfortune and for a while the old woman standing beside him could not hear the approaching footsteps for the mumble of his prayer.

Riva had fled to the farthest room where she hid behind the big oaken sideboard.

A shattering blow at the door sent a convulsive tremor through the two old people.

"Open the door!" Another blow, still more violent than the first, descended on the door, followed by furious curses.

But those within, numb with fright, could not lift a hand to unfasten the door.

Outside the rifle butts pounded until the bolts gave way and the splintering door crashed open.

Armed men poured into the house; they searched every corner. A blow from a rifle butt smashed in the door leading into the shop and the front door bolts were drawn from within.

The looting began.

When the carts had been piled high with cloth, shoes and other loot, Salomyga set out with the booty to Golub's quarters. When he returned he heard a shriek of terror issuing from the house.

Palyanytsya, leaving his men to sack the shop, had walked into the proprietor's apartment and found the old folks and the girl standing there. Casting his green lynx-like eyes over them he snapped at the old couple: "Get out of here!" Neither mother nor father stirred.

Palyanytsya took a step forward and slowly drew his sabre.

"Mama!" the girl gave a heart-rending scream. It was this that Salomyga heard.

Palyanytsya turned to his men who had run in at the cry.

"Throw them out!" he barked, pointing at the two old people. When this had been done, he told Salomyga who had now appeared. "You watch here at the door while I have a chat with the wench."

The girl screamed again. Old Peisakh made a rush for the door leading into the room, but a violent blow in the chest sent him reeling back against the wall, gasping with pain. Like a she-wolf fighting for her young, Toiba, the old mother, always so quiet and submissive, now flung herself at Salomyga.

"Let me .in! What are you doing to my girl?" She was struggling to get to the door, and try as he might Salomyga could not break her convulsive grip on his coat.

Peisakh, now recovered from the shock and pain, came to Toiba's assistance.

"Let us pass! Let us pass! Oh my daughter!"

Between them the old couple managed to push Salomyga away from the door. Enraged, he jerked his revolver from under his belt and brought the steel grip down hard upon the old man's grey head. Peisakh crumpled to the floor.

Inside the room Riva was screaming.

Toiba was dragged out of the house frantic with grief, and the street echoed to her wild shrieks and entreaties for help.

Inside the house everything was quiet.

Palyanytsya came out of the room. Without looking at Salomyga, whose hand was already on the door handle, he said:

"No use going in—she choked when I tried to shut her up with a pillow." As he stepped over Peisakh's body he put his foot into a dark sticky mess.

"Bad beginning," he muttered as he went outside. 

The others followed him without a word, leaving behind bloody footprints on the floor and the stairs. 

Pillage was in full swing in the town. Brief savage clashes flared up between brigands over the division of the spoils, and here and there sabres flashed. And almost everywhere fists flailed without restraint. From the beer saloon twenty-five gallon kegs were rolled out onto the street. 

Then the looters began to break into Jewish homes. 

There was no resistance. They went through the rooms, hastily turned every corner upside down, and went away laden with booty, leaving behind disordered heaps of clothing and the fluttering contents of ripped feather beds and pillows. The first day took a toll of only two victims: Riva and 

her father; but the oncoming night carried with it the unavoidable menace of death. 

By evening the motley crew of scavengers was roaring drunk. The crazed Petlyura men were waiting for the night. 

Darkness released them from the last restraint. It is easier to destroy a man in the pit of night; even the jackal prefers the hours of gloom. 

Few would ever forget these two terrible nights and three days. How many crushed and mangled lives they left behind, how many youthful heads turned grey in these bloody hours, how many bitter tears were shed! It is hard to tell whether those were the more fortunate who were left to live with souls desolated, in the agony of shame and humiliation, gnawed by indescribable grief for loved ones who would never return. In the narrow alleys lay the lacerated, tormented, broken bodies of young girls with arms thrown back in convulsive gestures of agony. 

Only at the very riverfront, in the house where Naum the blacksmith lived, the jackals who fell upon his young wife Sarah got a fierce rebuff. The smith, a man of powerful build in the prime of his twenty-four years and with the steel muscles of one who wielded the sledge-hammer for a living, did not yield his mate. 

In a brief but furious clash in the tiny cottage the skulls of two Petlyura men were crushed like rotten melons. With the terrible fury of despair, the smith fought fiercely for two lives, and for a long time the dry crackle of rifle fire could be heard from the river bank where the brigands now rushed, sensing the danger. With only one round of ammunition left, the smith mercifully shot his wife, and himself rushed out to his death, bayonet in hand. He was met by a squall of lead and his powerful body crashed to the ground outside his front door. 

Prosperous peasants from nearby villages drove into town in carts drawn by well-fed horses, loaded their waggon boxes with whatever met their fancy, and, escorted by sons and relatives serving in Golub's force, hurried home so as to make another trip or two to town and back. 

Seryozha Bruzzhak, who together with his father had hidden half of his printshop comrades in the cellar and attic, was crossing the garden on his way home when he saw a man in a long, patched coat running up the road, violently swinging his arms. 

It was an old Jew, and behind the bareheaded, panting man whose features were paralysed with mortal terror, galloped a Petlyura man on a grey horse. The distance between them dwindled fast and the mounted man leaned forward in the saddle to cut down his victim. Hearing the hoofbeats behind him, the old man threw up his hands as if to ward off the blow. At that moment Seryozha leapt onto the road and threw himself in front of the horse. 

"Stop, you dog of a bandit!"

The rider, making no effort to stay the descending sabre, brought the flat of the blade down on the fair young head.

雨点劈劈啪啪地敲打着窗户。屋顶上的雨水刷刷地往下流。劲风阵阵，吹得花园里的樱桃树惊慌地东摇西晃，树枝不时撞在窗玻璃上。冬妮亚已多次抬起头来，谛听着是不是有人敲门。她终于明白，这不过是风在捣乱，于是皱起了眉头。风雨声搅得她再也写不下去了，惆怅袭上了心头。她面前的桌子上摊着几张写得满满的信纸。她写完最后一页，裹紧了披巾，拿起刚写好的信，重读了一遍。

亲爱的塔妮亚：我父亲的助手偶然路过基辅，我请他捎这封信给你。

好久没有给你写信了，请别见怪。

眼下这种兵荒马乱的日子，全都乱糟糟的，思绪也理不出来。即便有心思写信，邮路又不通，也没有人捎。

你已经知道，父亲不同意我再去基辅。七年级我只好在本地的中学念了。

我很想念朋友们，尤其是你。我在这里一个同学也没有。

跟前大多是些庸俗乏味的男孩和土里土气、却又高傲自大的蠢女孩。

前几封信里，我跟你谈到过保夫鲁沙。我原先以为，我对这个小锅炉工的感情不过是年轻人的逢场作戏，昙花一现的恋情在生活中是随处可见的。可我想错了，塔妮亚，实际情况并非如此。是的，我们两个都还很稚嫩，年龄加起来才三十三岁。但是，这里面却有着某种更为严肃的东西。我不知道该叫什么，反正不是逢场作戏。

如今，在这淫雨连绵、泥泞遍地的深秋季节，在这寂寞无聊的小城里，我对这个邋里邋遢的小火夫的突发之情竟充满了我的全部身心，装点着周围灰蒙蒙一片的生活。

我本是个不安分的小女孩，有时还爱异想天开，一心要在生活中寻找某种不同寻常的夺目光彩。我从这样一个小女孩成长起来，从一大堆读过的小说中成长起来。这些小说常常触发你对生活的奇想，促使你去追求一种更为绚丽、更为充实的生活，而不满足于那种叫人厌恶和腻烦的、千篇一律的灰暗生活，这后一种生活却正是跟我类似的绝大多数女性所习惯了的。在对不同寻常的夺目光彩的追求中，我产生了对保尔的感情。我熟悉的那些年轻人中，没有一个有他那样坚强的意志，那样明确无误而又别具一格的生活见解，没有一个。而我和他的友谊本身也是非同一般的。正是因为追求夺目的光彩，也因为我异想天开地要“考验考验”他，有一次我差点没要了他的小命。这件事眼下回想起来，我都觉得十分惭愧。

这是夏末的事。我跟保尔来到湖边的一座悬崖上，这是我喜爱的地方。真是鬼迷心窍，我竟会生出来一个再考验他一次的念头。那座陡峭的悬崖你是知道的，去年夏天我领你去过，足足有五俄丈［一俄丈等于２．１３４米。——译者］高。我简直疯了，对他说：“你不敢跳下去，你害怕。”

他朝下面的湖水看了看，摇摇头说：“活见鬼！干吗，我的命不值钱哪？谁活得不耐烦，他跳就是了。”

我这样挑逗他，他以为是开玩笑。别看我多次亲眼看到他表现得很勇敢，有时甚至天不怕地不怕，此时此刻我却认为，他敢做的，也就是打个架啦，冒个险啦，偷支手枪啦，以及诸如此类的小事，真正要冒生命危险的大无畏精神，他还谈不上。

接下来发生的事实在糟糕，叫我一辈子再也不敢去干那种想入非非的蠢事。我告诉他，我不大相信他那么勇敢，只是检验他一下，是否真有胆量跳悬崖，不过我并不强迫他这样做。当时我简直着了迷，觉得太有意思了，为了进一步激他，又提出了这样的条件：如果他真是男子汉，想博得我的爱情，那就跳下去，跳过之后，他就可以得到我。

塔妮亚，我现在深深意识到，这太过分了。他对我的建议惊讶不已，凝视了我片刻。我还没有来得及站起来，他已经甩掉脚上的鞋子，纵身从悬崖上跳了下去。

我吓得尖叫起来，可一切都晚了——他那挺直的身躯飞速向水面落下去。短短的三秒钟，在我却是长得没有尽头。当水面激起的巨大浪花把他的身子掩盖起来的瞬间，我害怕极了，顾不得滑下悬崖的危险，忧心如焚地张望着水面一圈圈漾开去的波纹。似乎是无尽的等待之后，水面上终于露出了我心爱的那颗黑色的头。我号啕大哭，迅速向通湖边的小路飞奔过去。

我知道，他跳崖并不是为了得到我，我许下的愿至今没有偿还，而是为了永远结束这种考验。

树枝敲击着窗户，不让我写下去。今天我的心情一点也不好，塔妮亚。周围的一切是那么黯淡，这对我的情绪也有影响。

车站上列车不间断。德国人在撤退。他们从四面八方汇合到这里，然后分批登车离去。据说，离这里二十俄里的地方，起义者和撤退的德军在交战。你是知道的，德国也发生了革命，他们急着回国去。火车站的工人快跑光了。像要出什么事，我说不上来，可心里惶惶然不可终日。等你的回信。

爱你的　冬妮亚

１９１８年１１月２９日

激烈而残酷的阶级斗争席卷着乌克兰。愈来愈多的人拿起了武器，每一次战斗都有新的人参加进来。

小市民过惯了的那种安宁平静的日子，已经成为遥远的往事了。

战争的风暴袭来，隆隆炮声震撼着破旧的小屋。小市民蜷缩在地窖的墙根底下，或者躲在自家挖的避弹壕里。

佩特留拉手下那些五花八门的匪帮在全省横冲直撞，什么戈卢勃、阿尔汉格尔、安格尔、戈尔季以及诸如此类的大小头目，这些数不清的各式各样匪徒，到处为非作歹。

过去的军官、右翼和“左翼”乌克兰社会革命党党徒，一句话，任何一个不要命的冒险家，只要能纠集一批亡命徒，就都自封为首领，不时还打起佩特留拉的蓝黄旗，用尽一切力量和手段夺取政权。

“大头目佩特留拉”的团和师，就是由这些乌七八糟的匪帮，加上富农，还有小头目科诺瓦利茨指挥的加里西亚地方的攻城部队拼凑起来的。红色游击队不断向这帮社会革命党和富农组成的乌合之众冲杀，于是大地就在这无数马蹄和炮车车轮下面颤抖。

在那动乱的一九一九年的四月，吓得昏头昏脑的小市民，早上起来，揉着惺忪的睡眼，推开窗户，提心吊胆地询问比他起得早的邻居：“阿夫托诺姆·彼得罗维奇，今天城里是哪一派掌权？”

那个阿夫托诺姆·彼得罗维奇一边系裤带，一边左右张望，惶恐地回答：“不知道啊，阿法纳斯·基里洛维奇。夜里开进来一些队伍。等着瞧吧。要是抢劫犹太人，那就准是佩特留拉的人，要是‘同志们’，那一听说话，也就知道了。我这不是在看吗，看到底该挂谁的像，可别弄错了，招惹是非。您知道吗，隔壁的格拉西姆·列昂季耶维奇就是因为没看准，糊里糊涂地把列宁的像挂了出去。刚好有三个人冲他走过来，没想到就是佩特留拉手下的人。他们一看见列宁像，就把格拉西姆抓住了。好家伙，一口气抽了他二十马鞭，一边打一边骂：‘狗杂种，共产党，我们扒你的皮，抽你的筋！’不管格拉西姆怎么分辩，怎么哭喊，都不顶事。”

正说着，有一群武装人员沿着公路走来。他们俩看见，赶紧关上窗户，藏了起来。日子不太平啊！……

至于工人们，却是怀着满腔的仇恨瞧着佩特留拉匪帮的蓝黄旗。他们还没有力量对抗“乌克兰独立运动”这股沙文主义的逆流。只有当浴血奋战的红军部队击退佩特留拉匪帮的围攻，从这一带路过，像楔子一样插进城里的时候，工人们才活跃起来。亲爱的红旗只在市参议会房顶上飘扬一两天，部队一撤，黑暗又重新降临了。

现在这座小城的主人是外第聂伯师的“荣耀和骄傲”戈卢勃上校。昨天他那支两千个亡命徒的队伍趾高气扬地开进了城。

上校老爷骑着黑色的高头大马走在队伍的前面。尽管四月的太阳已经暖烘烘的了，他还是披着高加索毡斗篷，戴着扎波罗什哥萨克的红顶羔皮帽子，里边穿的是切尔克斯长袍，佩着全副武装：有短剑，有镶银马刀。

戈卢勃上校老爷是个美男子：黑黑的眉毛，白白的脸，只是由于狂饮无度，脸色白里透着微黄，而且嘴里总是叼着烟斗。革命前，上校老爷在一家糖厂的种植园里当农艺师，但是那种生活寂寞无聊，根本不能同哥萨克头目的赫赫声势相比。于是，这位农艺师就乘着浊流在全国泛滥的机会，浮游上来，成了戈卢勃上校老爷。

为了欢迎新来的队伍，城里唯一的剧院正在举行盛大的晚会。佩特留拉派士绅界的全部“精华”都出席了：一些乌克兰教师，神甫的大女儿、美人阿妮亚，小女儿季娜，一些小地主，波托茨基伯爵过去的管事，自称“自由哥萨克”的一帮小市民，以及乌克兰社会革命党的党徒。

剧场里挤得满满的。女教师、神甫的女儿和小市民太太们穿着鲜艳的乌克兰绣花民族服装，戴着珠光宝气的项链，饰着五彩缤纷的飘带。她们周围是一群响着马刺的军官。这些军官活像古画上的扎波罗什哥萨克。

军乐队奏着乐曲。舞台上正在忙乱地准备演出《纳扎尔·斯托多利亚》。

但是没有电。事情报告到司令部上校老爷那里。上校老爷正打算光临今天的晚会，为晚会锦上添花。他听了副官（此人原是沙皇陆军少尉，姓波良采夫，现在摇身一变，成了哥萨克少尉帕利亚内查）的报告以后，漫不经心但又威风凛凛地下命令说：“电灯一定要亮。你就是掉了脑袋，也要给我找到电工，立即发电。”

“是，上校大人。”

帕利亚内查少尉并没有掉脑袋，他找到了电工。

一个小时之后，他的两个士兵押着保尔来到发电厂。电工和机务员也是用同样的办法找来的。

帕利亚内查指着一根铁梁，直截了当地对他们说：“要是到七点钟电灯还不亮，我就把你们三个统统吊死在这里！”

这个简短的命令奏了效。到了指定的时间，电灯果然亮了。

当上校老爷带着他的情人到达剧场的时候，晚会进入了高潮。上校的情人是一个胸部丰满、长着浅褐色头发的姑娘，是上校的房东、酒店老板的女儿。

酒店老板很有钱，他曾把女儿送到省城中学念过书。

他们在前排荣誉席就坐之后，上校老爷表示节目可以开演了。于是帷幕立刻拉开，观众看到了匆忙跑进后台的导演的背影。

演剧的时候，军官们带着女伴在酒吧间里大吃大喝。那里有神通广大的帕利亚内查搜罗来的上等私酒和强征来的各种美味。到剧终的时候，他们已经酩酊大醉了。

帕利亚内查跳上舞台，装腔作势地把手一扬，用乌克兰话宣布：“诸位先生，现在开始跳舞！”

台下的人一齐鼓掌，接着就都走到院子里，好让那些担任晚会警卫的士兵搬出椅子，清理舞场。

半小时以后，剧场里又热闹起来。

舞兴大发的佩特留拉军官们同那些热得满脸通红的当地美人疯狂地跳着果拍克舞。他们用力跺着脚，震得这座旧剧场的墙壁直发颤。

正在这个时候，一队骑兵从磨坊那边朝城里跑来。

城边有戈卢勃部队的机枪岗哨。哨兵发现了正在走近的骑兵，警觉起来，急忙扑到机枪跟前，哗啦一声推上枪机。夜空里响起了厉声的呼喊：“站住！干什么的？”

黑暗中有两个模糊的人影走上前来。其中一个走到岗哨跟前，用醉鬼的破锣嗓子吼道：“我是头目帕夫柳克，后边是我的部队，你们是戈卢勃的人吗？”

“是的。”一个军官迎上前去说。

“把我的队伍安顿在哪儿？”帕夫柳克问。

“我马上打电话问司令部。”军官说完，走进了路边的小屋。

一分钟以后，他从小屋里跑出来，命令说：“弟兄们，机枪从大路上撤开，给帕夫柳克大人让路。”

帕夫柳克勒住缰绳，在灯火辉煌的剧院门口停住了。剧场外面十分热闹。

“嗬，挺快活呢，”他转身对身边的哥萨克大尉说。“古克马奇，下马吧，咱们也来乐一乐。这儿有的是娘们，挑几个可心的玩玩。”接着他喊了一声：“喂，斯塔列日科！你安排弟兄们住到各家去。我们就留在这儿了。卫兵跟我来。”他一翻身，沉甸甸地跳到地上，把马带得摇晃了一下。

两名武装卫兵在剧院门口拦住了帕夫柳克。

“票？”

帕夫柳克轻蔑地瞧了他们一眼，肩膀一拱，把一个卫兵推到了一边。他身后的十二个人也这样跟着闯进了剧院。他们的马匹留在外面，拴在栅栏上。

进来的人立刻引起了场内人们的注意。特别显眼的是帕夫柳克。他身材高大，穿着上等呢料的军官制服和蓝色近卫军制裤，戴着毛茸茸的高加索皮帽，肩上斜挎着一支毛瑟枪，衣袋里露出一颗手榴弹。

“这个人是谁？”人们交头接耳地问。他们正在看疯狂的“风雪舞”，戈卢勃的助手领着一帮人，围成一圈，跳得正起劲。

他的舞伴是神甫的大女儿。她兴奋到了极点，飞速地旋转着，裙子就像扇子一样展开，露出她那丝织的三角裤衩。这使周围的军官们看得非常开心。

帕夫柳克用肩膀挤开人群，走进圈子里。

他用混浊的目光盯着神甫女儿的大腿，舔了舔干燥的嘴唇，然后挤出圈子，径直朝乐队走去。他走到舞台脚灯前站住，挥舞了一下马鞭，喊道：“奏果拍克舞曲，卖点力气！”

乐队指挥没有理睬他。

帕夫柳克扬起马鞭，朝着指挥的后背使劲抽了一鞭。指挥像给蝎子蜇了似的，跳了起来。

音乐立刻停止了，全场顿时寂静下来。

“太霸道了！”酒店老板的女儿气愤地说。“你可不能轻饶了他。”她神经质地抓住坐在身旁的戈卢勃的胳膊。

戈卢勃慢腾腾地站起来，一脚踢开面前的椅子，三大步就走到帕夫柳克跟前，面对面站住了。他立刻认出这个人就是同他在本县争地盘的对手帕夫柳克。他正有一笔帐要找这家伙算呢。

这个帕夫柳克曾用最卑鄙的手段暗算过他戈卢勃上校老爷。

事情是这样的：一周以前，当戈卢勃的队伍正同多次叫他吃苦头的红军酣战的时候，帕夫柳克本来应该从背后袭击布尔什维克，但是他没有这样做，反而把部队拉到一个小镇，消灭了红军几个岗哨，轻而易举地占领了小镇。接着就把周围警戒起来，在镇里撒开手大肆抢劫。作为佩特留拉的“嫡系”部队，他们蹂躏的对象是犹太人。

就在那个时候，红军把戈卢勃的右翼打得落花流水，然后撤走了。

现在，这个恬不知耻的骑兵大尉又闯到这里，竟敢当着他上校老爷的面，动手打他的乐队指挥。不行，他决不能善罢甘休。戈卢勃心里明白，要是他现在不给这个妄自尊大的小头目一点厉害瞧瞧，往后他在部下的心目中就会威信扫地。

他们俩虎视眈眈地对峙了几秒钟。

戈卢勃一只手紧紧握住马刀柄，另一只手去摸衣袋里的手枪。他大声喝道：“混蛋！你竟敢打我的部下！”

帕夫柳克的一只手也慢慢地移向毛瑟枪枪套。

“冷静点，冷静点，戈卢勃大人，小心栽个大跟头。别专踩别人的鸡眼嘛，我也会发火的。”

这实在太过分了。

“把他们抓起来，拉出去，每人二十五鞭子，给我狠狠抽！”

戈卢勃大叫。

他部下的军官立刻像一群猎狗似的，从四面八方扑向帕夫柳克那一伙。

啪的一声，有人放了一枪，如同灯泡摔在地上一样。接着，这两群野狗扭到一起，厮打起来。混战中，他们用马刀胡乱对砍，你揪我的头发，我掐你的脖子。吓掉了魂的女人们，像猪崽一样尖叫着，四散逃开。

几分钟以后，帕夫柳克一伙人被解除了武装。戈卢勃的人一边打，一边拖，把他们弄到院子里，然后扔到了大街上。

帕夫柳克被打得鼻青脸肿，羊皮高帽丢了，武器也没有了。他气得暴跳如雷，带着手下的人跳上马，顺着大街飞奔而去。

晚会没法进行下去了。在这场厮打之后，谁也没有心思再寻欢作乐了。女人们都坚决拒绝跳舞，要求送她们回家。可是戈卢勃的牛脾气上来了。他下命令说：“谁都不许离开剧场，派人把住门！”

帕利亚内查赶忙执行了命令。

剧场里喧声四起，但是戈卢勃置之不理，仍然固执地宣布：“诸位先生和女士，我们今天要跳个通宵。现在我来领头跳一个华尔兹舞。”

乐队又奏起乐曲，但是舞还是没有跳成。

上校和神甫女儿还没有跳完第一圈，哨兵就闯了进来，大声报告：“帕夫柳克的人把剧院包围了！”

舞台旁边的一个临街窗户哗啦一声被打得粉碎。一挺机枪的枪筒像猪嘴似的，从破窗里探进来。它蠢笨地左右转动着，似乎在搜索剧场里慌忙逃跑的人群。人们一齐挤向剧场的中央，躲避这个可怕的魔鬼。

帕利亚内查瞄准天棚上那只一千瓦的大灯泡放了一枪，灯泡炸开来，雨点般的碎玻璃撒落在人们身上。

场内立时一片漆黑。街上传来了吼声：“都滚出来！”跟着是一连串下流的咒骂。

女人们歇斯底里地尖叫着，戈卢勃在场内来回奔跑，厉声吆喝，想把惊慌失措的军官们集合起来。这些声音跟外面的喊声、枪声汇成一片，混乱到了极点。谁都没有注意到帕利亚内查像一条泥鳅一样，从后门溜到了空荡荡的后街上，向戈卢勃的司令部跑去。

半小时后，城里展开了正式的战斗。爆豆般的枪声夹杂着机枪的哒哒声，打破了夜的寂静。吓得昏头昏脑的小市民们从热乎乎的被窝里跳出来，脸贴着窗户向外张望。

阿夫托诺姆·彼得罗维奇在床上抬起头，竖起耳朵听着。

不，他没有听错——是在开枪，他急忙跳下床。鼻子在窗玻璃上压得扁扁的，他就这样站了一会儿。无可怀疑：城里在开火。

得赶紧把谢甫琴科［谢甫琴科（１８１４—１８６１），乌克兰诗人，画家。——译者］肖像下面的小旗撤下来。贴佩特留拉的小旗，红军来了就要遭殃。谢甫琴科的肖像倒不妨，红军白军都尊重他。塔拉斯·谢甫琴科真是个好人，挂他的肖像不用提心吊胆，不管谁来，都不会有什么说道。旗子可就是另一回事了。他阿夫托诺姆可不是傻瓜，不是格拉西姆·列昂季耶维奇那样的糊涂虫。既然有两全其美的办法，干吗非冒这个险挂列宁的像？

他逐一把小旗撕下来，可钉子钉得太紧了。他一使劲，身子失去了平衡，咕咚一声重重地摔倒在地上。妻子被响声惊醒，一骨碌爬了起来……

“你怎么，疯啦，老不死的？”

阿夫托诺姆·彼得罗维奇骶骨摔得生疼，正好没有地方出气，冲着妻子叫喊：“你就知道睡、睡。上天国也会让你睡过了头。城里出了天大的事，可你还是睡个没完。挂旗是我的事，摘旗也是我的事，跟你就不相干？”

他的唾沫星子飞到妻子的脸上。她用被子蒙住头，阿夫托诺姆·彼得罗维奇只听到她愤愤地嘟囔：“白痴！”

枪声逐渐稀疏，回音仍然像榔头敲击着窗框，城边上的蒸汽机磨坊附近，一挺机枪像狗叫似的，断断续续地响着。

东方透出了鱼肚白。

城里有个传闻不胫而走，说烧杀掳掠犹太人的事不久就要发生。消息也传到了肮脏的犹太居民区。那里是一些歪歪扭扭、又矮又窄的破房子，对对付付地修建在高高的河岸上。

犹太贫民拥挤不堪地住在这些勉强可以称做房屋的盒子里。

谢廖沙在印刷厂做工已经一年多了。厂里的排字工人和其他工人全是犹太人。谢廖沙同他们处得很好，亲如一家。他们同心协力，团结在一起，共同对付那个傲慢的大肚子老板勃柳姆斯坦。印刷工人同老板不断地进行斗争。老板总是拼命想多榨取一些利润，少支付一些工资。就因为这个，工人们多次罢工，印刷厂一停工就是两三个星期。厂里有十四名工人，谢廖沙最年轻，但是摇起印刷机来，一气也要干十二个小时。

今天，谢廖沙发现工人们情绪不安。在最近这几个动乱的月份里，印刷厂没有经常的订货，只是印些哥萨克大头目的告示。

患肺病的排字工人门德利把谢廖沙叫到一个角落里，用忧郁的目光注视着他，问：“城里又要虐杀犹太人了，你知道吗？”

谢廖沙吃惊地看了他一眼，说：“没听说，不知道。”

门德利把又瘦又黄的手放在谢廖沙肩上，用长辈的口气信赖地对他说：“虐犹的事十有八九要发生。犹太人又要遭殃了。我想问问你，你愿不愿意帮助自己的伙伴躲过这场大灾大难？”

“只要我办得到，当然愿意。你说吧，门德利，要我干什么？”

其他排字工人都注意地听着他俩的谈话。

“谢廖沙，你是个好小伙子，我们信得过你。再说，你爸爸也是个工人。你现在赶快回家，问问你爸爸，能不能让几个老人和妇女藏到你们家去。谁到你们家，咱们再商量。你再同家里人合计合计，看谁家还能帮忙藏几个。这帮土匪暂时还不会碰俄罗斯人。快去吧，谢廖沙，晚了就来不及了。”

“行，门德利，你放心，我马上到保尔和克利姆卡家去一趟，他们两家也一定会收留你们的。”

“等一等。”门德利有点担心，慌忙叫住要走的谢廖沙。

“保尔和克利姆卡是什么人？靠得住吗？”

谢廖沙很有把握地点点头，说：“看你说的，当然靠得住。他们都是我的好朋友。保尔的哥哥是个钳工。”

“啊，原来是阿尔焦姆，”门德利这才放了心。“我认得他，我们在一个房子里住过。他很可靠。去吧，谢廖沙。快去快回，给我个信。”

谢廖沙立刻朝门外跑去。

戈卢勃和帕夫柳克双方发生冲突后的第三天，虐杀犹太人的暴行开始了。

那天帕夫柳克打败了，被赶出了城。他夹起尾巴溜到邻近的一个小镇，占领了那个地方。在夜战中，他损失了二十几个人，戈卢勃的损失也差不多。

死者的尸体匆忙运到公墓，草草掩埋了。没有举行仪式，因为这种事没什么可炫耀的。两个头目一见面就像野狗一样对咬起来，再大办丧事，可不是什么体面的事。帕利亚内查本来想在下葬的时候铺张一番，并且宣布柏夫柳克是赤匪，但是以瓦西里神甫为首的社会革命党委员会反对这样做。

那天夜间的冲突在戈卢勃的部队里引起了不满，特别是在警卫连，因为这个连的损失最大。为了平息不满情绪，提高士气，帕利亚内查建议戈卢勃让部下“消遣”一下。这个无耻的家伙所说的“消遣”，就是虐杀犹太人。他说这样做是非常必要的，不然就没有办法消除部队中的不满情绪。上校本来不打算在他和酒店老板的女儿举行婚礼之前破坏城里的平静，但是听帕利亚内查讲得那么严重，也就同意了。

不错，上校老爷已经加入了社会革命党，再搞这种名堂，多少有些顾虑。他的敌手又会乘机制造反对他的舆论，说他戈卢勃上校是个虐犹狂，而且一定会在大头目面前说他许多坏话。好在他戈卢勃目前并不靠大头目过日子。他的给养全是自己筹措的。其实，大头目自己也完全清楚，他手下的弟兄是些什么货色。他本人就曾不止一次要他们奉献所谓征来的财物，以解决他那个“政府”的财政困难。至于说戈卢勃是虐犹狂，那么在这一点上他早就名声在外了，再干一次，他的名声也不见得再坏到哪里去。

烧杀抢劫从大清早就开始了。

小城笼罩在破晓前的灰雾里。犹太居民区的街道空荡荡的，毫无生气。这些街道像浸过水的麻布条，把那些歪歪斜斜的犹太人住屋胡乱捆在一起。小屋的窗户上都挂着窗帘，上着窗板，不透一丝光亮。

表面上看来，小屋里的人都沉浸在黎明前的甜梦里。其实，他们并没有睡，而是穿着衣服，一家人挤在一个小房间里，准备应付即将来临的灾难。只有不懂事的婴孩才无忧无虑地、香甜地睡在妈妈的怀抱里。

这天早上，戈卢勃的卫队长萨洛梅加，一个脸长得像吉卜赛人、腮上有一条绛紫色刀痕的黝黑的家伙，很长时间都没能摇醒戈卢勃的副官帕利亚内查。

帕利亚内查睡得死死的，他正做着噩梦，怎么也醒不过来。他梦见一个龇牙咧嘴的驼背妖怪，伸着爪子搔他的喉咙，这个妖怪折磨了他一整夜。最后，他终于抬起那疼得要裂开来的脑袋，明白过来，原来是萨洛梅加在叫他。

“醒醒吧，你这个瘟神！”萨洛梅加一面抓住他的肩膀摇晃，一面喊。“已经不早了，该动手啦！让酒把你灌死才好呢！”

帕利亚内查总算完全清醒了，坐了起来。胃疼得他歪扭着嘴，他吐了一口苦水。

“什么该动手了？”他用无神的眼睛瞪着萨洛梅加。

“怎么？干犹太人去呀，你糊涂了？”

这回帕利亚内查想起来了：可不是，他把这事给忘了。昨天上校带着未婚妻和一群酒鬼溜到郊外田庄里，他们灌了个酩酊大醉。

戈卢勃认为，在抢劫和屠杀犹太人期间，他最好回避一下，别留在城里。往后他可以推脱责任，说这是他不在时发生的一场误会。他离开的这段时间，足够帕利亚内查漂漂亮亮地大干一场了。嘿，这个帕利亚内查，搞这种“消遣”可是个大行家！

帕利亚内查往头上浇了一桶冷水，思考的能力完全恢复了。他在司令部里东跑西颠，下达了一连串的命令。

警卫连已经上了马。办事精明的帕利亚内查为了避免引起麻烦，又命令设置岗哨，把工人住宅区和车站通城区的道路切断。在列辛斯基家的花园里架了一挺机枪，监视大路。如果工人出来干涉，就用铅弹对付他们。

一切安排就绪之后，副官和萨洛梅加才跨上马。

已经出发了，帕利亚内查忽然想起一件事，立即下令：“站住。差点忘了大事。带上两辆大车，咱们给戈卢勃弄点礼物，好办喜事。哈，哈，哈！……第一批到手的东西照例归司令。第一个娘们，哈，哈，哈，可得归我这个副官。明白吗，蠢货？”

最后这句话他是问萨洛梅加的。

萨洛梅加朝他翻翻黄眼珠，说：“有的是，够大伙受用的。”

队伍顺着大路出发了。副官和萨洛梅加走在前面，警卫连乱哄哄地跟在后面。

晨雾消散了。眼前是一座两层楼房，生锈的招牌上写着：“福克斯百货店”。帕利亚内查勒住了马缰。

他那匹细腿灰骒马不耐烦地踢了一下脚下的石路。

“好啦，上帝保佑，就打这儿开始吧。”帕利亚内查说着，下了马。

“喂，弟兄们，下马吧！”他转身对围上来的卫兵们说。

“好戏开场了。弟兄们，小心，可别敲碎那些猪猡的脑壳，收拾他们的机会多得很。说到娘们呢，要是还能熬得住，那就等到晚上再说。”

一个卫兵龇着大牙抗议说：“少尉大人，这话怎么说？要是两厢情愿呢？”

周围的人一阵哄笑。帕利亚内查赞赏地看了看那个卫兵。

“当然喽，要是两厢情愿，那就尽管干好了。谁也没有权利禁止这种事。”

帕利亚内查走到紧闭着的店门前，使劲踢了一脚。但是结实的柞木大门纹丝不动。

是的，不该从这里开始。副官握着军刀，绕过墙角，朝福克斯的住宅门口走去。萨洛梅加跟在后面。

房子里的人早就听到了路上的马蹄声。当马走到店铺前面停下，墙外传来说话声的时候，他们的心都要蹦出来了，吓得气都不敢出。这时屋里一共有三个人。

财主福克斯昨天就带着妻子和女儿逃出了城，只留下女仆丽娃看守房产。丽娃是一个温顺胆小的女孩子，才十九岁。

福克斯怕她一个人不敢住这么大的空房子，就叫她把父母接来同住，直到福克斯回来。

起初丽娃不怎么同意留下，这个狡猾的商人就骗她说，虐犹的事不一定发生。再说，他们从你们穷人手里能抢到什么东西呢？等他回来以后，一定赏给她钱买衣服。

现在，三个

Part One Chapter 5
---

The Red forces were pressing down hard on "Chief Ataman" Petlyura's units, and Golub's regiment was called to the front. Only a small rearguard detachment and the Commandant's detail were left in the town.

The people stirred. The Jewish section of the population took advantage of the temporary lull to bury their dead, and life in the tiny huts of the Jewish quarter returned to normal.

On quiet evenings an indistinct rumble was carried from the distance; somewhere not too far off the fighting was in progress.

At the station, railwaymen were leaving their jobs to roam the countryside in search of work.

The Gymnasium was closed.

Martial law was declared in town.

It was a black, ugly night, one of those nights when the eyes, strain as they might, cannot pierce the gloom, and a man gropes about blindly expecting at any moment to fall into a ditch and break his neck.

The respectable citizen knows that at a time like this it is safer to sit at home in the dark; he will not light a lamp if he can help it, for light might attract unwelcome guests. Better the dark, much safer. There are of course those who are always restless—let them venture abroad if they wish,that's none of the respectable citizen's business. But he himself will not risk going out—not for anything.

It was one of those nights, yet there was a man abroad.

Making his way to the Korchagin house, he knocked cautiously at the window. There was no answer and he knocked again, louder and more insistently.

Pavel dreamed that a queer creature, anything but human, was aiming a machine gun at him; he wanted to flee, but there was nowhere to go, and the machine gun had broken into a terrifying chatter.

He woke up to find the window rattling. Someone was knocking.

Pavel jumped out of bed and went to the window to see who it was, but all he could make out was a vague dark shape.

He was all alone in the house. His mother had gone on a visit to his eldest sister, whose husband was a mechanic at the sugar refinery. And Artem was blacksmithing in a neighbouring village,wielding the sledge for his keep.

Yet it could only be Artem.

Pavel decided to open the window.

"Who's there?" he said into the darkness.

There was a movement outside the window and a muffled bass replied:

"It's me, Zhukhrai."

Two hands were laid on the windowsill and Fyodor's head came up until it was level with Pavel's face. 

"I've come to spend the night with you. Any objections, mate?" Zhukhrai whispered. 

"Of course not," Pavel replied warmly. "You know you're always welcome. Climb in." 

Fyodor squeezed his great bulk through the opening. 

He closed the window but did not move away from the window at once. He stood listening intently, and when the moon slipped out from behind a cloud and the road became visible he scanned it carefully. Then he turned to Pavel. 

"We won't wake up your mother, will we?" 

Pavel told him there was nobody home besides himself. The sailor felt more at ease and spoke in a louder voice. 

"Those cutthroats are after my hide in earnest now, matey. They've got it in for me after what happened over at the station. If our fellows would stick together a bit more we could have given the greycoats a fine reception during the pogrom. But folks, as you see, aren't ready to plunge into the fire yet, and so nothing came of it. Now they're looking for me, twice they've had the dragnet out —today I got away by the skin of my teeth. I was going home, you see, by the back way of course, and had just stopped at the shed to look around, when I saw a bayonet sticking out from behind a tree trunk. I naturally cast off and headed for your place. If you've got nothing against it I'll drop anchor here for a few days. All right, mate? Good." 

Zhukhrai, still breathing heavily, began pulling off his mud-splashed boots. 

Pavel was glad he had come. The power plant had not been working latterly and Pavel felt lonely in the empty house. 

They went to bed. Pavel fell asleep at once, but Fyodor lay awake for a long time smoking. 

Presently he rose and, tiptoeing on bare feet to the window, stared out for a long time into the street. Finally, overcome by fatigue, he lay down and fell asleep, but his hand remained on the butt of the heavy Colt which he had tucked under the pillow.

Zhukhrai's unexpected arrival that night and the eight days spent in his company influenced the whole course of Pavel's life. From the sailor Pavel learned much that was new to him, and that stirred him to the depths of his being. 

Driven into hiding, Zhukhrai made use of his enforced idleness to pass on to the eager Pavel all his passionate fury and burning hatred for the Ukrainian Nationalists who were throttling the area. 

Zhukhrai spoke in language that was vivid, lucid and simple. He had no doubts, his path lay clearly before him, and Pavel came to see that all this tangle of political parties with high-sounding names—Socialist-Revolutionaries, Social-Democrats, Polish Socialists—was a collection of vicious enemies of the workers, and that the only revolutionary party which steadfastly fought against the rich was the Bolshevik Party. 

Formerly Pavel had been hopelessly confused about all this. 

And so this staunch, stout-hearted Baltic sailor weathered by sea squalls, a confirmed Bolshevik, who had been a member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) since 1915, taught Pavel the harsh truths of life, and the young stoker listened spellbound. 

"I was something like you, matey, when I was young," he said. "Just didn't know what to do with my energy, a restless youngster always ready to kick over the traces. I was brought up in poverty. 

And at times the very sight of those pampered, well-fed sons of the town gentry made me see red. 

Often enough I beat them up badly, but all I got out of it was a proper trouncing-from my father. 

You can't change things by carrying on a lone fight. You, Pavlusha, have all the makings of a good fighter in the workingman's cause, only you're still very young-and you don't know much about the class struggle. I'll put you on the right road, matey, because I know you'll make good. I can't stand the quiet, smug-sort. The whole world's afire now. The slaves have risen and the old life's got to be scuttled. But to do that we need stout fellows, not sissies, who'll go crawling into cracks like so many cockroaches when the fighting starts, but men with guts who'll hit out without mercy." 

His fist crashed down on the table. 

He got up, frowning1, and paced up and down the room with hands thrust deep in his pockets. 

His inactivity depressed him. He bitterly regretted having-stayed behind in this town, and believing any further stay to be pointless, was firmly resolved to make his way through the front to meet the Red units. 

A group of nine Party members would remain in town to carry on the work. 

"They'll manage without me. I can't sit around any longer doing- nothing1. I've wasted ten months as it is," Zhukhrai thought irritably. 

"What exactly are you, Fyodor?" Pavel had asked him once. 

Zhukhrai got up and shoved his hands into his pockets. He did not grasp the meaning of the question at first. 

"Don't you know?" 

"I think you're a Bolshevik or a Communist," Pavel said in a low voice. 

Zhukhrai burst out laughing, slapping his massive chest in its tight-fitting striped jersey. 

"Right enough, matey! It's as much a fact as that Bolshevik and Communist are one and the same thing." Suddenly he grew serious. "But now that you've grasped that much, remember it's not to be mentioned to anyone or anywhere, if you don't want them to draw and quarter me. Understand?" 

"I understand," Pavel replied firmly. Voices were heard from the yard and the door was pushed open without a preliminary knock. Zhukhrai's hand slipped into his pocket but emerged again when Sergei Bruzzhak, thin and pale, with a bandage on his head, entered the room, followed by Valya and Klimka. 

"Hullo, old man," Sergei shook Pavel's hand and smiled. "Decided to pay you a visit, all three of us. Valya wouldn't let me go out alone, and Klimka is afraid to let her go by herself. He may be a redhead but he knows what he's about." 

Valya playfully clapped her hand over his mouth. "Chatterbox," she laughed. "He won't give Klimka any peace today." 

Klimka showed his white teeth in a good-natured grin. "What can you do with a sick fellow? 

Brain pan's damaged, as you can see." They all laughed. 

Sergei, who had not yet recovered from the effects of the sabre blow, settled on Pavel's bed and soon the young people were engaged in a lively conversation. As he told Zhukhrai the story of his encounter with the Petlyura bandit, Sergei, usually so gay and cheerful, was quiet and depressed. 

Zhukhrai knew the three young people, for he had visited the Bruzzhaks on several occasions. He liked these youngsters; they had not yet found their place in the vortex of the struggle, but the aspirations of their class were clearly expressed in them. He listened with interest to the young people's account of how they had helped to shelter Jewish families in their homes to save them from the pogrom. That evening he told the young folk much about the Bolsheviks, about Lenin, helping them to understand what was happening. 

It was quite late when Pavel's guests left. Zhukhrai went out every evening and returned late at night; before leaving town he had to discuss with the comrades who would remain in town the work they would have to do. 

This particular night Zhukhrai did not come back, When Pavel woke up in the morning he saw at a glance that the sailor's bed had not been slept in. 

Seized by some vague premonition, Pavel dressed hurriedly and left the house. Locking the door and putting the key in the usual place, he went to Klimka's house hoping that the latter would have some news of Fyodor. Klimka's mother, a stocky woman with a broad face pitted with pockmarks, 

was doing the wash. To Pavel's question whether she knew where Fyodor was she replied curtly: "You'd think I'd nothing else to do but keep an eye on your Fyodor. It's all through him—the devil take him— that Zozulikha's house was turned upside down. What've you got to do with him? A queer lot, if you ask me. Klimka and you and the rest of them. . . ." She turned back in anger to her washtub. 

Klimka's mother was an ill-tempered woman, with a biting tongue. . . . 

From Klimka's house Pavel went to Sergei's where he voiced his fears. 

"Why should you be so worried?" said Valya. "Perhaps he stayed over at some friend's place." But her words lacked confidence. 

Pavel was too restless to stop at the Bruzzhaks for long, and although they tried to persuade him to stay for dinner he took his leave. 

He headed back home in hopes of finding Zhukhrai there. 

The door was locked. Pavel stood outside for a while with a heavy heart; he couldn't bear the thought of going into the deserted house. 

For a few minutes he stood in the yard deep in thought, then, moved by an impulse, he went into the shed. He climbed up under the roof and brushing away the cobwebs reached into his secret hiding place and brought out the heavy Mannlicher wrapped in rags.

He left the shed and went down to the station, strangely elated by the feel of the revolver weighing down his pocket. 

But there was no news of Zhukhrai at the station. On the way back his step slowed down as he drew alongside the now familiar garden of the forest warden. With a faint flicker of hope, he looked up at the windows of the house, but it was as lifeless as the garden. When he had passed the garden he turned back to glance at the paths now covered with a rusty crop of last year's leaves. The place seemed desolate and neglected—no industrious hand had laid a visible imprint here—and the dead stillness of the big old house made Pavel feel sadder still. 

His last quarrel with Tonya had been the most serious they had had. It had all happened quite unexpectedly, nearly a month ago. 

As he slowly walked back to town, his hands shoved deep into his pockets, Pavel recalled how it had come about. 

They had met quite by chance on the road and Tonya had invited him over to her place.

"Dad and mother are going to a birthday party at the Bolshanskys, and I'll be all alone. Why don't you come over, Pavlusha? I have a very interesting book we could read—Leonid Andreyev's Sashka Zhigulyov. I've already finished it, but I'd like to reread it with you. I'm sure it would be a nice evening. Will you come?"

Her big, wide-open eyes looked at him expectantly from under the white bonnet she wore over her thick chestnut hair.

"I'll come."

At that they parted.

Pavel Hurried to his machines, and the very thought that he had a whole evening with Tonya to look forward to, made the flames in the firebox seem to burn more brightly and the burning logs to crackle more merrily than usual.

When he knocked at the wide front door that evening it was a slightly disconcerted Tonya who answered.

"I have visitors tonight. I didn't expect them, Pavlusha. But you must come in," she said.

Pavel wanted to go and turned to the door.

"Come in," she took him by the arm. "It'll do them good to know you." And putting her arm around his waist, she led him through the dining room into her own room.

As they entered she turned to the young people seated there and smiled.

"I want you to meet my friend Pavel Korchagin."

There were three people sitting around the small table in the middle of the room: Liza Sukharko, a pretty, dark-complexioned Gymnasium student with a pouting little mouth and a fetching coiffure,a lanky youth in a well-tailored black jacket, his sleek hair shining with hair-oil, and a vacant look in his grey eyes, and between them, in a foppish school jacket, Victor Leszczinski. It was him Pavel saw first when Tonya opened the door.

Leszczinski too recognised Korchagin at once and his fine arched eyebrows lifted in surprise.

For a few seconds Pavel stood silent at the door, eyeing Victor with frank hostility. Tonya hastened to break the awkward silence by asking Pavel to come in and turning to Liza to introduce her.

Liza Sukharko, who was inspecting the new arrival with interest, rose from her chair.

Pavel, however, turned sharply and strode out through the semidark dining room to the front door.

He was already on the porch when Tonya overtook him and seized him by the shoulders.

"Why are you running off? I especially wanted them to meet you."

Pavel removed her hands from his shoulders and replied sharply:

"I'm not going to be put on a show before that dummy. I don't belong to that crowd—you may like them, but I hate them. If I'd known they were your friends I'd never have come."

Tonya, suppressing her rising anger, interrupted him:

"What right have you to speak to me like that? I don't ask you who your friends are and who comes to see you."

"I don't care whom you see, only I'm not coming here any more," Pavel shot back at her as he went down the front steps. He ran to the garden gate.

He had not seen Tonya since then. During the pogrom, when he and the electrician had hidden several Jewish families at the power station, he had forgotten about the quarrel, and today he wanted to see her again.

Zhukhrai's disappearance and the knowledge that there was no one at home depressed Pavel. The grey stretch of road swung to the right ahead of him. The spring mud had not yet dried, and the road was pitted with holes filled with brown mire. Beyond a house whose shabby, peeling facade jutted out onto the edge of the pavement the road forked off.

Victor Leszczinski was saying good-bye to Liza at the street intersection opposite a wrecked stand with a splintered door and an inverted "Mineral Water" sign. He held her hand in his as he spoke, pleadingly gazing into her eyes. 

"You will come? You won't deceive me?" 

"Of course I shall come. You must wait for me," Liza replied coquettishly. 

And as she left him she smiled at him with promise in her misty hazel eyes. 

A few yards farther down the street Liza saw two men emerge from behind a corner onto the roadway. The first was a sturdy, broadchested man in worker's clothes, his unbuttoned jacket revealing a striped jersey underneath, a black cap pulled down over his forehead, and brown, low-topped boots on his feet. There was a blue-black bruise under his eye. 

The man walked with a firm, slightly rolling gait. 

Three paces behind, his bayonet almost touching the man's back, came a Petlyura soldier in a grey coat and two cartridge pouches at his belt. From under his shaggy sheepskin cap two small, wary eyes watched the back of his captive's head. Yellow, tobacco-stained moustaches bristled on either 

side of his face. 

Liza slackened her pace slightly and crossed over to the other side of the road. Just then Pavel emerged onto the highway behind her. 

As he passed the old house and turned to the right at the bend in the road, he too saw the two men coming toward him. 

Pavel stopped with a start and stood as if rooted to the ground. The arrested man was Zhukhrai. 

"So that's why he didn't come back!" 

Zhukhrai was coming nearer and nearer. Pavel's heart pounded as if it would burst. His thoughts raced madly as his mind sought vainly to grasp the situation. There was not enough time for deliberation. Only one thing was clear: Zhukhrai was caught. 

Stunned and bewildered Pavel watched the two approach. What was to be done? 

At the last moment he remembered the revolver in his pocket. As soon as they passed him he would shoot the man with the rifle in the back, and Fyodor would be free. With that decision reached on the spur of the moment his mind cleared. After all, it was only yesterday that Fyodor had told him: "For that we need stout fellows. . . ." 

Pavel glanced quickly behind him. The street leading to town was deserted; there was not a soul in sight. Ahead a woman in a light coat was hurrying across the road. She would not interfere. The second street branching off at the intersection he could not see. Only far away on the road to the station some people were visible. 

Pavel moved over to the edge of the road. Zhukhrai saw him when they were only a few paces apart. 

Zhukhrai looked at him from the corner of his eye and his thick eyebrows quivered. The unexpectedness of the encounter made him slow down his step. The bayonet pricked him in the back.

"Lively, there, or you'll get a taste of this butt!" cried the escort in a screechy falsetto.

Zhukhrai quickened his pace. He wanted to speak to Pavel, but refrained; he only waved his hand as if in greeting.

Fearing to attract the attention of the yellow-moustached soldier, Pavel turned aside as Zhukhrai passed, as if completely indifferent to what was going on.

But in his head drilled the anxious thought: "What if I miss him and the bullet hits Zhukhrai. . . ."

But there was no time to think.

When the yellow-moustached soldier came abreast of him, Pavel made a sudden lunge at him and seizing hold of the rifle struck the barrel down.

The bayonet hit the pavement with a grating sound.

The attack caught the soldier unawares, and for a moment he was dumbfounded. Then he violently jerked the rifle toward himself. Throwing the full weight of his body on it, Pavel managed to retain his grip. A shot crashed out, the bullet striking a stone and ricocheting with a whine into the ditch.

Hearing the shot, Zhukhrai leapt aside and spun around. The soldier was wrenching at the rifle fiercely in an effort to tear it out of Pavel's hands. Pavel's arms were painfully twisted, but he did not release his hold. Then with a sharp lunge the enraged Petlyura man threw Pavel down on the ground, but still he could not wrench the rifle loose. Pavel went down, dragging the soldier down with him. Nothing could have made him relinquish the rifle at this crucial moment.

In two strides Zhukhrai was alongside the struggling pair. His iron fist swung through the air and descended on the soldier's head; a second later the Petlyura man had been wrenched off Pavel and,sagging under the impact of two smashing blows in the face, his limp body collapsed into the wayside ditch.

The same strong hands that had delivered those blows lifted Pavel from the ground and set him on his feet.

Victor, who by this time had gone a hundred paces or so from the intersection, walked on whistling La donna e mobile, his spirits soaring after his meeting with Liza and her promise to see him at the abandoned factory the next day.

Among the Gymnasium youths Liza Sukharko had the reputation of being rather daring in her love affairs. That arrogant braggart Semyon Zalivanov had once declared that Liza had surrendered to him, and although Victor did not quite believe Semyon, Liza nevertheless intrigued him. Tomorrow he would find out whether Zalivanov had spoken the truth or not.

"If she comes I shan't be bashful. After all, she lets you kiss her. And if Semyon is telling the truth. . . ." Here his thoughts were interrupted as he stepped aside to let two Petlyura soldiers pass.

One of them was astride a dock-tailed horse, swinging a canvas bucket—evidently on his way to water the animal. The other, in a short jacket and loose blue trousers, was walking alongside,resting his hand on the rider's knee and telling him a funny story.

Victor let them pass and was about to continue on his way when a rifle shot on the highway made him stop in his tracks. He turned and saw the mounted man spurring his horse toward the sound,while the other soldier ran behind, supporting his sabre with his hand.

Victor ran after them. When he had almost reached the highway another shot rang out, and from around the corner came the horseman galloping madly. He urged on the horse with his heels and the canvas bucket, and leaping to the ground at the first gateway shouted to the men in the yard:

"To arms! They've killed one of our men!"

A minute later several men dashed out of the yard, clicking the bolts of their rifles as they ran.

Victor was arrested.

Several people were now gathered on the road, among them Victor and Liza, who had been detained as a witness.

Liza had been rooted to the spot from fright, and hence had a good view of Zhukhrai and Korchagin when they ran past; much to her surprise she realised that the lad who had attacked the Petlyura soldier was the one Tonya had wanted to introduce to her.

The two had just vaulted over the fence into a garden when the horseman came galloping down the street. Noticing Zhukhrai running with a rifle in his hands and the stunned soldier struggling to get back on his feet, the rider spurred his horse towards the fence.

Zhukhrai, however, turned around, raised the rifle and fired at the pursuer, who swung around and beat a hasty retreat.

The soldier, barely able to speak through his torn lips, was now telling what had happened.

"You dunderhead, what do you mean by letting a prisoner get away from under your nose? Now you're in for twenty-five strokes for sure."

"Smart, aren't you?" the soldier snapped back angrily. "From under my nose, eh? How was I to know the other bastard would jump on me like a madman?"

Liza too was questioned. She told the same story as the escort, but she omitted to say that she knew the assailant. Nevertheless they were all taken to the Commandant's office, and were not released until evening.

The Commandant himself offered to see Liza home, but she refused. His breath smelled of vodka and the offer boded no good.

Victor escorted Liza home.

It was quite a distance to the station and as they walked along arm in arm Victor was grateful for the incident.

"You haven't any idea who it was that freed the prisoner?" Liza asked as they were approaching her home.

"No, I haven't. How can I?"

"Do you remember the evening Tonya wanted to introduce a certain young man to us?"

Victor halted.

"Pavel Korchagin?" he asked, surprised.

"Yes, I think his name was Korchagin. Remember how he walked out in such a funny way? Well,it was he."

Victor stood dumbfounded.

"Are you sure?" he asked Liza.

"Yes. I remember his face perfectly."

"Why didn't you tell the Commandant?"

Liza was indignant.

"Do you think I would do anything so vile?"

"Vile? You call it vile to tell who attacked the escort?"

"And do you consider it honourable? You seem to have forgotten what they've done. Have you any idea how many Jewish orphans there are at the Gymnasium, and yet you'd want me to tell them about Korchagin? I'm sorry, I didn't expect that of you."

Leszczinski was much surprised by Liza's reply. But since it did not fit in with his plans to quarrel with her, he tried to change the subject.

"Don't be angry, Liza, I was only joking. I didn't know you were so upright."

"The joke was in very bad taste," Liza retorted dryly.

As he was saying good-bye to her outside the Sukharko house, Victor asked:

"Will you come then, Liza?"

"I don't know," she replied vaguely.

Walking back to town, Victor turned the matter over in his mind. "Well, mademoiselle, you may think it vile, but I happen to think differently. Of course it's all the same to me who freed whom."

To him as a Leszczinski, the scion of an old Polish family, both sides were equally obnoxious. The only government he recognised was the government of the Polish gentry, the Rzecz Pospolita, and that would soon come with the Polish legions. But here was an opportunity to get rid of that scoundrel Korchagin. They'd twist his neck sure enough.

Victor was the only member of the family to have remained in town. He was staying with an aunt,who was married to the assistant director of the sugar refinery. His family had been living for some time in Warsaw, where his father Sigismund Leszczinski occupied a position of some importance.

Victor walked up to the Commandant's office and turned into the open door.

Shortly afterwards he was on his way to the Korchagin house accompanied by four Petlyura men.

"That's the place," he said quietly, pointing to a lighted window. "May I go now?" he asked the Khorunzhy.

"Of course. We'll manage ourselves. Thanks for the tip."

Victor hurried away.

The last blow in the back sent Pavel reeling into the dark room to which they had led him, and his outstretched arms collided with the opposite wall. Feeling around he found something like a bunk,and he sat down, bruised and aching in body and spirit.

The arrest had come as a complete surprise. How had the Petlyura crowd found out about him? He was sure no one had seen him. What would happen next? And where was Zhukhrai?

He had left the sailor at Klimka's place. From there he had gone to Sergei, while Zhukhrai remained to wait for the evening in order to slip out of town.

"Good thing I hid the revolver in the crow's nest," Pavel thought. "If they had found it, it would have been all up with me. But how did they find out?" There was no answer to the question that tormented him.

The Petlyura men had not got much out of the Korchagin house although they made a thorough search of its every corner. Artem had taken his best suit and the accordion to the village, and his mother had taken a trunk with her, so that there was little left for them to pick up.

The journey to the guardhouse, however, was something Pavel would never forget. The night was pitch black, the sky overcast with clouds, and he had blundered along, blindly and half-dazed,propelled by brutal kicks from all sides.

He could hear voices behind the door leading into the next room, which was occupied by the Commandant's guard. A bright strip of light showed under the door. Pavel got up and feeling his way along the wall walked around the room. Opposite the bunk he discovered a heavily barred window. He tried the bars with his hand— they were immovable. The place had obviously been a storeroom.

He made his way to the door and stood there for a moment listening. Then he pressed lightly on the handle. The door gave a sickening creak and Pavel swore violently under his breath.

Through the narrow slit that opened before him he saw a pair of calloused feet with crooked toes sticking out over the edge of a bunk. Another light push against the handle and the door protested louder still. A dishevelled figure with a sleep-swollen face now rose up in the bunk and fiercely scratching his lousy head with all five fingers burst into a long tirade. When the obscene flow of abuse ended, the creature reached out to the rifle standing at the head of the bunk and added phlegmatically:

"Shut that door and if I catch you looking in here once more I'll bash in your. . . ."

Pavel shut the door. There was a roar of laughter in the next room.

He thought a great deal that night. His initial attempt to take a hand in the fight had ended badly for him. The very first step had brought capture and now he was trapped like a mouse.

Still sitting up, he drifted into a restless half-sleep, and the image of his mother with her peaked, wrinkled features and the eyes he loved so well rose before him. And the thought: "It's a good thing she's away—that makes it less painful."

A grey square of light from the window appeared on the floor.

The darkness was .gradually retreating. Dawn was approaching.

红军步步紧逼，不断向大头目佩特留拉的部队发动进攻。

戈卢勃团被调上了前线。城里只留下少量后方警卫部队和警备司令部。

人们又走动起来。犹太居民利用这暂时的平静，掩埋了被杀的亲人。犹太居民区的那些小屋里又出现了生机。

寂静的夜晚，隐隐约约可以听到枪炮声。战斗就在不远的地方进行。

铁路工人都离开了车站，到四乡去找活干。

中学关门了。

城里宣布了戒严。

这是一个黑沉沉的、阴郁的夜。

乌云犹如远方大火腾起的团团浓烟，在昏暗的天空缓慢浮动，移近一座佛塔，便用浓重的烟雾把它遮掩起来。佛塔变得模糊了，仿佛抹上了一层污泥，而逼近的乌云仍在不断给它着色，越着越深。昏黄的月亮发出微微颤抖的光，也沉没在乌云之中，如同掉进了黑色的染缸。

在这样的时刻，即使你把眼睛睁得滴溜圆，也难以穿越这重重夜幕。于是人们只好像瞎子走路，张开手去摸，伸出脚去探，而且随时都有跌进壕沟、摔得头破血流的危险。

在这样的时刻，一个人鬼迷心窍迈出家门，到大街上去乱跑，头破血流的事还少得了吗？更何况又是在一九一九年四月这样的岁月，脑袋或者身上让子弹钻个把窟窿，嘴里让铁枪托敲落几颗牙齿，本来就是稀松平常的事。

小市民都知道，这种时候得坐在家里，最好也别点灯。灯可是个惹祸的货色。这不，有人不是不请自到，奔灯光去了？

真是，硬是自个儿给自个儿找麻烦。屋里黑洞洞的，最保险。

要是有人耐不得寂寞，非要出门，那就让他去好了。确实有那么一些人，没个老实的时候。那好，悉听尊便，见鬼去吧。

这跟小市民有什么相干？小市民自己才不出去乱跑呢。放心好了，绝不会出去的。

可就是在这样一个深夜，却有一个人匆匆地在街上行走。

他双脚不时陷进泥里，遇到特别难走的地方，嘴里骂骂咧咧地吐出几句脏话。

他走到柯察金家的小屋前，小心翼翼地敲了敲窗框。没有人应声。他又敲了敲，比第一次更响些，也更坚决些。

保尔正在做梦。他梦见一个似人非人的怪物用机枪对着他，他想逃，可是又无处可逃。那挺机枪发出了可怕的响声。

外面还在固执地敲着窗子，震得玻璃直响。

保尔跳下床，走到窗前，想看看是谁在敲。但是，外面只有一个模糊的人影，根本看不清是谁。

家里只有他一个人。母亲到他姐姐家去了。他姐夫在一家糖厂开机器。阿尔焦姆在邻近的村子里当铁匠，靠抡大锤挣饭吃。

敲窗的人一定是阿尔焦姆。

保尔决定打开窗子。

“谁？”他朝人影问了一声。

窗外的人影晃了一下，用压低了的粗嗓门说：“是我，朱赫来。”

接着，他两手按住窗台，纵身一跳，头就同保尔的脸一般高了。

“我到你家借宿来了，小弟弟，行吗？”他小声地问。

“当然行，那还用说！”保尔友好地回答。“你就从窗口爬进来吧。”

朱赫来粗壮的身体从窗口挤了进来。

他随手关好窗户，但是没有立刻离开那里。

他站在窗旁，倾听着窗外有没有动静。月亮从云层里钻出来，照亮了大路。他仔细观察了路上的情形，然后才转过身来，对保尔说：“咱们会把你母亲吵醒吗？她大概睡了吧？”

保尔告诉他，家里只有他一个人，水兵朱赫来这才放心，提高了嗓音说：“小弟弟，那帮吃人的野兽正在到处抓我。为了车站上最近发生的事，他们要找我算帐。虐杀犹太人的时候，要是大伙心再齐点，本来可以给那帮灰狗子一点厉害看的。可是人们还没有下火海的决心，所以没有干成。现在敌人正盯着我，已经两次设埋伏要抓我了。今天差点给逮住。刚才，我正回住处，当然啦，是从后门走的。走到板棚旁边一瞧，有个家伙藏在院子里，身子紧贴大树，可是刺刀露在外面，让我看见了。不用说，我转身就跑。这不是，一直跑到你家来了。小弟弟，我打算在你家抛锚，停几天船。你不反对吧？行。那就好了！”

朱赫来吭哧着，脱下那双沾满泥的靴子。

朱赫来的到来使保尔十分高兴。最近发电厂停工，他一个人呆在家里，冷冷清清的，觉得非常无聊。

两个人躺到床上。保尔马上就入睡了，朱赫来却一直在抽烟。后来，他又从床上起来，光着脚走到窗前，朝街上看了很久，才回到床上。他已经十分疲倦，躺下就睡着了。他的一只手伸到枕头底下，按在沉甸甸的手枪上，枪柄被焐得暖烘烘的。

朱赫来突然深夜到保尔家借宿，同保尔一起住了八天，这件事成了保尔生活中的一件大事。保尔第一次从水兵朱赫来嘴里听到这么多重要的、令人激动的新鲜道理。这八天对年轻锅炉工的成长，有着决定的意义。

水兵朱赫来已经两次遇险，他像关进铁笼的猛兽一样，暂时呆在这间小屋里。他对打着蓝黄旗蹂躏乌克兰大地的匪帮充满了仇恨。现在他就利用这段迫不得已而闲着的时间，把满腔怒火和憎恨都传给如饥似渴地听他讲话的保尔。

朱赫来讲得鲜明生动，通俗易懂。他对一切问题都有明确的认识。他坚信自己走的道路是正确的。保尔从他那里懂得了，那一大堆名称好听的党派，什么社会革命党、社会民主党、波兰社会党等等，原来都是工人阶级的凶恶敌人；只有一个政党是不屈不挠地同所有财主作斗争的革命党，这就是布尔什维克党。

以前保尔总是被这些名称弄得糊里糊涂的。

费奥多尔·朱赫来，这位健壮有力的革命战士，久经狂风巨浪的波罗的海舰队水兵，一九一五年就加入俄国社会民主工党的坚强的布尔什维克，对年轻的锅炉工保尔讲述着严峻的生活真理。保尔两眼紧紧地盯着他，听得入了神。

“小弟弟，我小时候跟你差不多，”朱赫来说。“浑身是劲，总想反抗，就是不知道力气往哪儿使。我家里很穷。一看见财主家那些吃得好穿得好的小少爷，我就恨得牙痒痒的。我常常狠劲揍他们。可是有什么用呢，过后还得挨爸爸一顿痛打。单枪匹马地干，改变不了这个世道。保夫鲁沙，你完全可以成为工人阶级的好战士，一切条件你都有，只是年纪还小了点，阶级斗争的道理，你还不大明白。小弟弟，我看你挺有出息，所以想跟你说说应该走什么路。我最讨厌那些胆小怕事、低声下气的家伙。现在全世界都燃起了烈火。奴隶们起来造反了，要把旧世界沉到海里去。但是，干这种事，需要的是勇敢坚强的阶级弟兄，而不是娇生惯养的公子哥儿；需要的是坚决斗争的钢铁战士，而不是战斗一打响就像蟑螂躲亮光那样钻墙缝的软骨头。”

朱赫来紧握拳头，有力地捶了一下桌子。

他站起身来，两手插在衣袋里，皱着眉头在屋里大步走来走去。

朱赫来闲得太难受了。他后悔不该留在这个倒霉的小城里。他认为再呆下去已经没有什么意义，所以，毅然决定穿过火线，找红军部队去。

城里还有一个九个人的党组织，可以继续进行工作。

“没有我，他们照样可以干下去。我可不能再在这儿闲呆着。已经浪费了十个月，够了。”朱赫来生气地想。

“费奥多尔，你到底是干什么的？”有一天，保尔问他。

朱赫来站起来，把手插在衣袋里。他一时没有弄明白这句话的意思。

“难道你还不知道我是干什么的吗？”

“我想你一定是个布尔什维克，要不就是个共产党。”保尔低声回答。

朱赫来哈哈大笑起来，逗乐似的拍拍被蓝白条水手衫紧箍着的宽胸脯。

“小弟弟，这是明摆着的事。不过布尔什维克就是共产党，共产党就是布尔什维克，这也是明摆着的事。”他接着严肃地说：“既然你已经知道了，你就应当记住：要是你不愿意他们整死我，那你不论在什么地方，不论对什么人，都不能泄漏这件事。懂吗？”

“我懂。”保尔坚定地回答。

这时，从院子里突然传来了说话声，没有敲门，人就进来了。朱赫来急忙把手伸到衣袋里，但是立刻又抽了出来。进来的是谢廖沙，他头上缠着绷带，脸色苍白，比以前瘦了。瓦莉亚和克利姆卡跟在他后面。

“你好，小鬼头！”谢廖沙笑着把手伸给保尔。“我们三个一道来看你。瓦莉亚不让我一个人来，不放心。克利姆卡又不放瓦莉亚一个人来，也是不放心。别看他一脑袋红毛，傻呵呵的，活像马戏团的小丑，倒还懂点好歹，知道让一个人独自到哪儿去有危险。”

瓦莉亚笑着捂住谢廖沙的嘴，说：“尽胡扯！今天他一直跟克利姆卡过不去。”

克利姆卡憨厚地笑着，露出洁白的牙齿。

“对病人只能将就点了。脑瓜子挨了一刀，难怪要胡说八道。”

大家都笑了。

谢廖沙还没有完全复原，就靠在保尔床上。朋友们随即热烈地交谈起来。谢廖沙一向高高兴兴，有说有笑，今天却显得沉静、抑郁，他把佩特留拉匪兵砍伤他的经过告诉了朱赫来。

朱赫来对来看保尔的这三个青年都很了解。他到勃鲁扎克家去过多次。他喜欢这些青年人。在斗争的漩涡中他们虽然还没有找到应该走的道路，但是却已经鲜明地表现出他们的阶级意识。朱赫来认真地听这些年轻人讲，他们每个人怎样把犹太人藏在自己家里，帮助他们躲过虐犹暴行。这天晚上，朱赫来也给青年们讲了许多关于布尔什维克和列宁的事情，帮助他们认识当前发生的种种事件。

保尔把客人送走的时候，天已经很晚了。

朱赫来每天傍晚出去，深夜才回来。他正忙着在离开之前，同留在城里的同志们商量今后的工作。

有一天，朱赫来一夜没有回来。保尔早上醒来，看见床铺还空着。

保尔模糊地预感到出了什么事情，慌忙穿好衣服，走了出去。他锁好屋门，把钥匙藏在约定的地方，就去找克利姆卡，想打听朱赫来的消息。克利姆卡的母亲是一个大脸盘、生着麻子的矮胖妇女，正在洗衣服。保尔问她知道不知道朱赫来在什么地方，她没好气地说：“怎么，我没事干，专给你看着朱赫来的？就是为了这个家伙，佐祖利哈家给翻了个底朝天。你找他干什么？你们凑在一起，倒真是好搭档，克利姆卡、你……”她一边说，一边狠狠地搓着衣服。

克利姆卡的母亲一向就是嘴皮子厉害，爱唠叨。

保尔从克利姆卡家出来，又去找谢廖沙。他把自己担心的事告诉了他。瓦莉亚在一旁插嘴说：“你担什么心呢？他也许在熟人家里住下了。”可是她的语气并不怎么自信。

保尔打算走了。瓦莉亚知道，保尔这几天在饿肚子，家里能卖的东西，全卖掉换吃的了，再也没有什么可卖的。她强迫保尔留下吃饭，否则便不再和他好。保尔也确实感到饥肠辘辘，于是留下饱餐了一顿。

保尔走近家门的时候，满心希望能在屋里看到朱赫来。

但是，屋门还是紧锁着。他心情沉重地站住了，真不愿走进这间空屋子。

他在门口站了几分钟，左思右想，一种说不出的力量推着他向板棚走去。他拨开蜘蛛网，把手伸到棚顶下面，从那个秘密的角落里掏出一支用破布包着的沉重的曼利赫尔手枪。

保尔从板棚出来，朝车站走去。口袋里装着那支沉甸甸的手枪，他心里有些紧张。

在车站上也没有打听到朱赫来的下落。回来的路上，刚好经过林务官家那熟悉的花园，他放慢了脚步，怀着连自己也不明白的希望，瞧着房子的窗户。但是花园里和房子里都没有人。走过去之后，他又回头朝花园的小径看了一眼。只见遍地都是去年的枯叶，整个花园显得十分荒凉。显然，那位爱护花草的主人已经好久没有侍弄过这座花园了。古老的大房子，冷落而又空荡的景象，更增添了保尔的愁思。

他和冬妮亚最后一次拌嘴，比以往任何一次都厉害。这是一个月以前突然发生的事。

保尔两手深深插在衣袋里，漫步朝城里走去，一面回忆着他和冬妮亚争吵的经过。

那天，他和冬妮亚偶然在路上相遇。冬妮亚邀他到家里去玩。

“我爸和我妈就要到博利尚斯基家去参加命名礼。只有我一个人在家。保夫鲁沙，你来吧，咱们一起读列奥尼德·安德列耶夫［列·安德列耶夫（１８７１—１９１９），俄国作家。——译者］的《萨什卡·日古廖夫》。这本小说很有意思。我已经看过了，可是非常愿意和你一起再读一遍。晚上你来，咱们一定可以过得很愉快。你来吗？”

一顶小白帽紧紧扣住她那浓密的栗色头发，帽子下面那双大眼睛期待地望着保尔。

“我一定来。”

他们分手了。

保尔急忙去上班。一想到他要和冬妮亚在一起度过整整一个晚上，炉火都显得分外明亮，木柴的噼啪声也似乎格外欢畅。

当天黄昏，冬妮亚听到他的敲门声，亲自跑来打开宽大的正门。她有点抱歉地说：“我来了几个客人。保夫鲁沙，我没想到他们会来，不过你可不许走。”

保尔转身想走，但是冬妮亚拉住他的袖子，说：“进来吧。让他们跟你认识认识，也有好处。”说着，就用一只手挽着他，穿过饭厅，把他带到自己的住室。

一进屋，她就微笑着对在座的几个年轻人说：“你们不认识吧？这是我的朋友保尔·柯察金。”

房间里的小桌子周围坐着三个人：一个是莉莎·苏哈里科，她是个漂亮的中学生，肤色微黑，生着一张任性的小嘴，梳着风流的发式；另一个是保尔没有见过的青年，他穿着整洁的黑外衣，细高个子，油光光的头发梳得服服帖帖的，一双灰眼睛现出寂寞忧郁的神情；第三个坐在他们两个人中间，穿着非常时髦的中学制服，他就是维克托·列辛斯基。冬妮亚推开门的时候，保尔第一眼看到的就是他。

维克托也立刻认出了保尔，他诧异地扬起尖细的眉毛。

保尔在门口一声不响地站了几秒钟，用充满敌意的眼光盯着维克托。冬妮亚急于打破这种令人难堪的僵局，一边请保尔进屋，一边对莉莎说：“来，给你介绍一下。”

莉莎好奇地打量着保尔，欠了欠身子。

保尔一个急转身，大步穿过半明半暗的饭厅，朝大门走去。冬妮亚一直追到台阶上才赶上他。她两手抓住保尔的肩膀，激动地说：“你为什么要走呢？我是有意叫他们跟你见见面的。”

但是保尔把她的手从肩上推开，不客气地说：“用不着拿我在这些废物跟前展览。我跟这帮家伙坐不到一块。也许你觉得他们可爱，我可是恨他们。我不知道他们是你的朋友，早知道这样，我是决不会来的。”

冬妮亚压住心头的火气，打断他的话头说：“谁给你的权利这样对我说话？我可是从来没问过你，你跟谁交朋友，谁常到你家去。”

保尔走下台阶，进入花园。一边走，一边斩钉截铁地说：“那就让他们来好了，我反正是不来了。”说完，就朝栅栏门跑去。

从那以后，他再没有见到冬妮亚。在发生虐犹暴行期间，保尔和电工一道忙着在发电厂藏匿犹太人家属，把这次口角忘掉了。但是今天，他却又很想见到冬妮亚。

朱赫来失踪了，家里等待着保尔的是孤独寂寞，一想到这里，他的心情就特别沉重。春天化冻以后，公路上的泥泞还没有全干，车辙里满是褐色的泥浆。整个公路像一条灰色的带子，拐到右边去了。

紧挨着路边有一座难看的房子，墙皮已经剥落，像长满疥癣一样。公路拐过这所房子，分成了两股岔道。

公路十字路口上有一个废弃的售货亭，门板已经毁坏，“出售矿泉水”的招牌倒挂着。就在这个破售货亭旁边，维克托正在同莉莎告别。

他久久握着莉莎的手，情意缠绵地看着她的眼睛，问：“您来吗？您不会骗我吧？”

莉莎卖弄风情地回答：“来，我一定来。您等我好了。”

临别的时候，莉莎那双懒洋洋的脉脉含情的棕色眼睛又对他微笑了一下。

莉莎刚走出十来步，就看见两个人从拐角后面走出来，上了大路。走在前面的是一个矮壮的、宽肩膀的工人，他敞着上衣，露出里面的水手衫，黑色的帽子低低地压住前额，一只眼睛又青又肿。

这个工人穿着一双短筒黄皮靴，腿略微有点弯屈，坚定地朝前走着。

在他后面约三步远，是一个穿灰军装的佩特留拉匪兵，腰带上挂着两盒子弹，刺刀尖几乎抵着前面那个人的后背。

毛茸茸的皮帽下面，一双眯缝着的眼睛警惕地盯着被捕者的后脑勺。他那给马合烟熏黄了的胡子朝两边翘着。

莉莎稍微放慢了脚步，走到公路的另一边。这时，保尔在她的后面也走上了公路。

当他向右转，往家走的时候，也发现了这两个人。

他马上认出了走在前面的是朱赫来。他的两只脚像在地上生了根一样，再也挪不动了。

“怪不得他没回家呢！”

朱赫来越走越近了。保尔的心猛烈地跳动着。各种想法一个接一个地涌上心头，简直理不出个头绪来。时间太紧迫了，一时拿不定主意。只有一点是清楚的：朱赫来这下子完了！

他瞧着他们走过来，心里乱腾腾的，不知道怎样办才好。

“怎么办？”

在最后一分钟，他才骤然想起口袋里的手枪。等他们走过去，朝这个端枪的家伙背后放一枪，朱赫来就能得救。一瞬间作出了这样的决定之后，他的思绪立即变得清晰了。他紧紧地咬着牙，咬得生疼。就在昨天，朱赫来还对他说过：“干这种事，需要的是勇敢坚强的阶级弟兄……”

保尔迅速朝后面瞥了一眼。通往城里的大路上空荡荡的，连个人影也没有。前面的路上，有一个穿春季短大衣的女人急急忙忙地走着。她不会碍事的。十字路口另一侧路上的情况，他看不见。只是在远处通向车站的路上有几个人影。

保尔走到公路边上。当他们相距只有几步远的时候，朱赫来也看见了保尔。

朱赫来用那只好眼睛看了看他，两道浓眉微微一颤，他认出了保尔，感到很意外，一下子愣住了。于是刺刀尖立刻杵着了他的后背。

“喂，快走，再磨蹭我就给你两枪托！”押送兵用刺耳的假嗓子尖声吆喝着。

朱赫来加快了脚步。他很想对保尔说几句话，但是忍住了，只是挥了挥手，像打招呼似的。

保尔怕引起黄胡子匪兵的疑心，赶紧背过身，让朱赫来走过去，好像他对这两个人毫不在意似的。

正在这时，他的脑子里突然又钻出一个令人不安的想法：“要是我这一枪打偏了，子弹说不定会打中朱赫来……”

那个佩特留拉匪兵已经走到他身旁了，事到临头，难道还能多想吗？

接下来发生的事是这样：当黄胡子押送兵走到保尔跟前的时候，保尔猛然向他扑去，抓住他的步枪，狠命向下压。

刺刀啪嗒一声碰在石头路面上。

佩特留拉匪兵没有想到会有人袭击，愣了一下。他立刻尽全力往回夺枪。保尔把整个身子的重量都压在枪上，死也不松手。突然一声枪响，子弹打在石头上，蹦起来，落到路旁的壕沟里去了。

朱赫来听到枪声，往旁边一闪，回过头来，看见押送兵正狂怒地从保尔手里往回夺枪。那家伙转着枪身，扭绞着少年的双手。但是保尔还是紧紧抓住不放。押送兵简直气疯了，猛一使劲，把保尔摔倒在地。就是这样，枪还是没有夺走。保尔摔倒的时候，就势把那个押送兵也拖倒了。在这样的关头，简直没有什么力量能叫保尔撒开手里的武器。

朱赫来两个箭步，蹿到他们跟前，他抡起拳头，朝押送兵的头上打去。紧接着，那个家伙的脸上又挨了两下铅一样沉重的打击。他松手放开躺在地上的保尔，像一只装满粮食的口袋，滚进了壕沟。

还是那双强有力的手，把保尔从地上扶了起来。

维克托已经从十字路口走出了一百多步。他一边走，一边用口哨轻声吹着《美人的心朝三暮四》。他仍然在回味刚才同莉莎见面的情景，她还答应明天到那座废弃的砖厂里去会面，他不禁飘飘然起来。

在追逐女性的中学生中间有一种传言，说莉莎是一个在谈情说爱问题上满不在乎的姑娘。

厚颜无耻而又骄傲自负的谢苗·扎利瓦诺夫有一次就告诉过维克托，说他已经占有了莉莎。维克托并不完全相信这家伙的话，但是，莉莎毕竟是一个有魅力的尤物，所以，他决意明天证实一下，谢苗讲的话是不是真的。

“只要她一来，我就单刀直入。她不是不在乎人家吻她吗？要是谢苗这小子没撒谎……”他的思路突然给打断了。迎面过来两个佩特留拉匪兵，维克托闪在一旁给他们让路。一个匪兵骑着一匹秃尾巴马，手里晃荡着帆布水桶，看样子是去饮马。另一个匪兵穿着一件紧腰长外套和一条肥大的蓝裤子，一只手拉着骑马人的裤腿，兴致勃勃地讲着什么。

维克托让这两个人过去以后，正要继续往前走，公路上突然响了一枪。他停住了脚步，回头一看，骑马的士兵一抖缰绳，朝枪响的地方驰去。另一个提着马刀，跟在后面跑。

维克托也跟着他们跑过去。当他快跑到公路的时候，又听到一声枪响。骑马的士兵惊慌地从拐角后面冲出来，差点撞在维克托身上。他又用脚踢，又用帆布水桶打，催着马快跑。跑到第一所士兵的住房，一进大门，就朝院子里的人大喊：“弟兄们，快拿枪，咱们的人给打死了！”

立刻有几个人一边扳动枪机，一边从院子里冲出来。

他们把维克托抓住了。

公路上已经捉来了好几个人。其中有维克托和莉莎。莉莎是作为见证人被扣留的。

当朱赫来和保尔从莉莎身旁跑过去的时候，她大吃一惊，呆呆地站住了。她认出袭击押送兵的竟是前些日子冬妮亚打算向她介绍的那个少年。

他们两人相继翻过了一家院子的栅栏。正在这个时候，一个骑兵冲上了公路，他发现了拿着步枪逃跑的朱赫来和挣扎着要从地上爬起来的押送兵，就立即驱马向栅栏这边扑来。

朱赫来回身朝他放了一枪，吓得他掉头就跑。

押送兵吃力地抖动着被打破的嘴唇，把刚才发生的事说了一遍。

“你这个笨蛋，让犯人从眼皮底下跑了！这回不打你屁股才怪，少不了二十五通条。”

押送兵恶狠狠地顶了他一句：“我看就你聪明！从眼皮底下跑了，是我放的吗？谁知道哪儿蹦出来那么一个狗崽子，像疯了一样扑到我的身上？”

莉莎也受到了盘问。她讲的和押送兵一样，只是没有说她认识袭击押送兵的那个少年。抓来的人都被带到了警备司令部。

直到晚上，警备司令才下令释放他们。

警备司令甚至要亲自送莉莎回家，但是她谢绝了。他酒气熏人，要送她回家，显然是不怀好意的。

后来由维克托陪她回家去。

从这里到火车站有很长一段路。维克托挽着莉莎的手，心里为这件偶然发生的事情感到乐滋滋的。

快要到家的时候，莉莎问他：“您知道救走犯人的是谁吗？”

“不知道，我怎么会知道呢？”

“您还记得那天晚上冬妮亚要给咱们介绍的那个小伙子吗？”

维克托停住了脚步。

“您说的是保尔·柯察金？”他惊奇地问。

“是的，他好像是姓柯察金。您还记得吗，那天他多么古怪，转身就走了？没错，就是他。”

维克托站在那里呆住了。

“您没认错人吧？”他又问莉莎。

“不会错的。他的相貌我记得很清楚。”

“那您怎么不向警备司令告发呢？”

莉莎气愤地说：“您以为我能干出这种卑鄙的事情来吗？”

“怎么是卑鄙呢？告发一个袭击押送兵的人，您认为就是卑鄙？”

“那么照您说倒是高尚的了？您把他们干的那些事都忘记了？您难道不知道学校里有多少犹太孤儿？您还让我去告发柯察金？谢谢您，我可真没想到。”

维克托想不到她会这样回答。他并不打算同莉莎争吵，所以就尽量把话题岔开。

“您别生气，莉莎，我是说着玩的。我不知道您竟会这样认真。”

“您这个玩笑开得可不怎么好。”莉莎冷冷地说。

在莉莎家门口分手的时候，维克托问：“莉莎，您明天来吗？

他得到的是一句模棱两可的回答：“再说吧。”

在回城的路上，维克托心里思量着：“好嘛，小姐，您尽可以认为这是卑鄙的，我可有我的看法。当然喽，谁放跑了谁，跟我都不相干。”

他，列辛斯基，一个波兰的世袭贵族，对冲突的双方都十分厌恶。反正波兰军队很快就要开来。到了那个时候，一定会建立一个真正的政权——正牌的波兰贵族政权，眼下，既然有干掉柯察金这个坏蛋的好机会，当然也不必错过。他们会马上把他的脑袋揪下来的。

维克托一家只有他一个人留在这座小城里。他寄居在姨母家，他的姨父是糖厂的副经理。维克托的父亲西吉兹蒙德·列辛斯基在华沙身居要职，母亲和涅莉早就跟着父亲到华沙去了。

维克托来到警备司令部，走进了敞开的大门。

过了一会儿，他领着四名佩特留拉匪兵向柯察金家走去。

他指着那个有灯光的窗户，低声说：“就是这儿。”然后，转身问他身旁的哥萨克少尉：“我可以走了吗？”

“您请便吧，我们自己能对付。谢谢您帮忙。”

维克托急忙迈开大步，顺人行道走了。

保尔背上又挨了一拳，被推进了一间黑屋子，伸出的两手撞在墙壁上。他摸来摸去，摸到一个木板床似的东西，坐了下来。他受尽了折磨和毒打，心情十分沉重。

保尔完全没有想到会被捕。“佩特留拉匪徒怎么会知道的呢？压根儿没人看见我呀！现在该怎么办呢？朱赫来在哪儿呢？”

保尔是在克利姆卡家同水兵朱赫来分手的。他又去看了谢廖沙，朱赫来就留在克利姆卡家，好等天黑混出城去。

“幸亏我把手枪藏到老鸹窝里去了，”保尔想。“要是让他们翻到，我就没命了。但是，他们怎么知道是我呢？”这个问题叫他伤透了脑筋，就是找不到答案。

佩特留拉匪徒并没有从柯察金家里翻到什么有用的东西。衣服和手风琴被哥哥拿到乡下去了。妈妈也带走了她的小箱子。匪兵们翻遍各个角落，捞到的东西却少得可怜。

然而，从家里到司令部这一路上的遭遇，保尔却是永远忘不了的。漆黑的夜，伸手不见五指。天空布满了乌云。匪兵们推搡他，从背后或两侧对他不停地拳打脚踢，毫不留情。

保尔昏昏沉沉地木然向前走着。

门外有人在谈话。司令部的警卫就住在外间屋。屋门下边透进一条明亮的光线。保尔站起身来，扶着墙壁，摸索着在屋里走了一圈。在板床对面，他摸到了一个窗户，上面安着结实的参差不齐的铁栏杆。用手摇了一下——纹丝不动。看样子这里以前是个仓库。

他又摸到门口，停下来听了听动静。然后，轻轻地推了一下门把手。门讨厌地吱呀了一声。

“妈的，真活见鬼！”保尔骂了一句。

从打开的门缝里，他看见床沿上有两只脚，十个脚趾叉开着，皮肤很粗糙。他又轻轻地推了一下门把手，门又毫不留情地尖叫起来。一个睡眼惺忪、头发蓬乱的家伙从床上坐了起来。他用五个手指头恶狠狠地挠着生满虱子的脑袋，懒洋洋地扯着单调的嗓音破口大骂起来。骂过一通之后，摸了一下放在床头的步枪，有气无力地吆喝说：“把门关上！再往外瞧，就打死你……”

保尔掩上门，外面房间里响起了一阵狂笑声。

这一夜保尔翻来覆去想了许多。他柯察金第一次参加斗争，就这么不顺利，刚刚迈出第一步，就像老鼠一样让人家捉住，关在笼子里了。

他坐在那里，心神不宁地打起瞌睡来。这时候，母亲的形象在脑海中浮现出来：她面孔瘦削，满脸皱纹，那双眼睛是多么熟悉，多么慈祥啊！他想：“幸亏妈不在家，少受点罪。”

从窗口透进来的光线照在地上，映出一个灰色的方块。

黑暗在逐渐退却。黎明已经临近了。

Part One Chapter 6
---

A light shone in only one window of the big old house; the curtains were drawn. Outside Tresor,now chained for the night, suddenly barked in his reverberating bass.

Through a sleepy haze Tonya heard her mother speaking in a low voice.

"No, she is not asleep yet. Come in, Liza."

The light footsteps of her friend and the warm, impulsive hug finally dispelled her drowsiness.Tonya smiled wanly.

"I'm so glad you've come, Liza. Papa passed the crisis yesterday and today he has been sleepingsoundly all day. Mama and I have had some rest too after so many sleepless nights. Tell me all the news." Tonya drew her friend down beside her on the couch.

"Oh, there's plenty of news, but some of it's for your ears only," Liza smiled with a sly look at Yekaterina Mikhailovna.

Tonya's mother smiled. She was a matronly woman of thirty-six with the vigorous movements of a young girl, clever grey eyes and a face that was pleasant if not beautiful. "I will gladly leave you alone in a few minutes, but first I want to hear the news that is fit for everybody's ears," she joked, pulling a chair up to the couch.

"Well, to begin with we've finished with school. The board has decided to issue graduation certificates to the seventh-graders. I am glad. I'm so sick of all this algebra and geometry! What good is it to anyone? The boys may possibly continue their studies, although they don't know where, with all this fighting going on. It's simply terrible. . . . As for us, we'll be married and wives don't need algebra," Liza laughed. After sitting with the girls for a little while, Yekaterina Mikhailovna went to her own room. Liza now moved closer to Tonya and with her arms about her gave her a whispered account of the encounter at the crossroads.

"You can imagine my surprise, Tonya, when I recognised the lad who was running away. Guess who it was?"

Tonya, who was listening with interest, shrugged her shoulders.

"Korchagin!" Liza blurted out breathlessly.

Tonya started and winced.

"Korchagin?"

Liza, pleased with the impression she had made, went on to describe her quarrel with Victor.

Carried away by her story, Liza did not notice Tonya's face grow pale and her fingers pluck nervously at her blue blouse. Liza did not know how Tonya's heart constricted with anxiety, nor did she notice how the long lashes that hid her beautiful eyes trembled. Tonya paid scant heed to Liza's story of the drunken Khorunzhy.

One thought gave her no rest:

"Victor Leszczinski knows who attacked the soldier. Oh, why did Liza tell him?" And in spite of herself the words broke from her lips. 

"What did you say?" Liza could not grasp her meaning at once.

"Why did you tell Leszczinski about Pavlusha . . . I mean Korchagin? He's sure to betray him. . . ."

"Oh, surely not!" Liza protested. "I don't think he would do such a thing. After all, why should he?"

Tonya sat up sharply and hugged her knees so hard that it hurt.

"You don't understand, Liza! He and Korchagin are enemies, and besides, there is something else. . . . You made a big mistake when you told Victor about Pavlusha."

Only now did Liza notice Tonya's agitation, and her use of Korchagin's first name confirmed what she had vaguely suspected.

She could not help feeling guilty and lapsed into an embarrassed silence.

"So it's true," she thought. "Fancy Tonya falling in love with a plain workman." Liza wanted to talk about it very much, but out of consideration for her friend she refrained. Anxious to atone for her guilt in some way, she seized Tonya's.

"Are you very worried, Tonya?"

"No, perhaps Victor is more honourable than I think," Tonya replied absently.

The awkward silence that ensued was broken by the arrival of a schoolmate of theirs, a bashful,gawky lad named Demianov.

After seeing her friends off, Tonya stood for a long time leaning against the wicket gate and staring at the dark strip of road leading to town. The wind laden with a chill dampness and the dank odour of the wet spring soil fanned her face. Dull red lights blinked in the windows of the houses over in the town. There it was, that town that lived a life apart from hers, and somewhere there, under one of those roofs, unaware of the danger that threatened him, was her rebellious friend Pavel. Perhaps he had forgotten her—how many days had flown by since their last meeting? He had been in the wrong that time, but all that had long been forgotten. Tomorrow she would see him and their friendship would be restored, a moving, warming friendship. It was sure to return—of that Tonya had not the slightest doubt. If only the night did not betray him, the night that seemed to harbour evil, as if lying in wait for him. . . . A shiver ran through her, and after a last look at the road, she went in.

The thought, "If only the night does not betray him", still drilled in her head as she dozed off.

Tonya woke up early in the morning before anyone else was about, and dressed quickly. She slipped out of the house quietly so as not to wake up the family, untied the big shaggy Tresor and set out for town with the dog. She hesitated for a moment in front of the Korchagin house, then pushed the gate open and walked into the yard.

Tresor dashed ahead wagging his tail. . . .

Artem had returned from the village early that same morning. The blacksmith he had worked for had given him a lift into town on his cart. On reaching home he threw the sack of flour he had earned on his shoulders and walked into the yard, followed by the blacksmith carrying the rest of his belongings. Outside the open door Artem set the sack down on the ground and called out;"Pavka!"

There was no answer.

"What's the hitch there? Why not go right in?" said the smith as he came up.

Setting his belongings down in the kitchen, Artem went into the next room. The sight that met his eyes there dumbfounded him: the place was turned upside down and old clothes littered the floor.

"What the devil is this?" Artem muttered completely at a loss. "It's a mess all right," agreed the blacksmith.

"Where's the boy got to?" Artem was getting angry. But the place was deserted and dead.

The blacksmith said good-bye and left.

Artem went into the yard and looked around.

"I can't make head or tail of this! All the doors wide open and no Pavka."

Then he heard footsteps behind him. Turning around he saw a huge dog with ears pricked standing before him. A girl was walking toward the house from the gate.

"I want to see Pavel Korchagin," she said in a low voice, surveying Artem.

"So do I. But the devil knows where he's gone. When I got here the house was unlocked and no Pavka anywhere about. So you're looking for him too?" he addressed the girl.

The girl answered with a question:

"Are you Korchagin's brother Artem?"

"I am. Why?"

Instead of replying, the girl stared in alarm at the open door. "Why didn't I come last night?" she thought. "It can't be, it can't be. . . ." And her heart grew heavier still.

"You found the door open and Pavel gone?" she asked Artem, who was staring at her in surprise.

"And what would you be wanting of Pavel, may I ask?" Tonya came closer to him and casting a look around spoke jerkily:

"I don't know for sure, but if Pavel isn't at home he must have been arrested."

Artem started nervously. "Arrested? What for?"

"Let's go inside," Tonya said.

Artem listened in silence while Tonya told him all she knew. By the time she had finished he was despairing.

"Damn it all! As if there wasn't enough trouble without this mess," he muttered gloomily. "Now I see why the place was turned upside down. What the hell did the boy have to get mixed up in this business for. . . . Where can I find him now? And who may you be, miss?"

"My father is forest warden Tumanov. I'm a friend of Pavel's."

"I see," Artem said absently. "Here I was bringing flour to feed the boy up, and now this. . . ."

Tonya and Artem looked at each other in silence.

"I must go now," Tonya said softly as she prepared to go. "I hope you'll find him. I'll come back later."

Artem gave her a silent nod.

A lean fly just awakened from its winter sleep buzzed in a corner of the window. On the edge of an old threadbare couch sat a young peasant woman, her elbows resting on her knees and her eyes fixed blankly on the filthy floor.

The Commandant, chewing a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth, finished writing on a sheet of paper with a flourish, and, obviously pleased with himself, added an ornate signature ending in a curlicue under the title "Commandant of the town of Shepetovka, Khorunzhy''. From the door came the clinking of spurs. The Commandant looked up.

Before him stood Salomyga with a bandaged arm.

"Hullo, what's blown you in?" the Commandant greeted him.

"Not a good wind, at any rate. Got my hand sliced to the bone by a Bogunets." ( Bogunets—a fighting man of the Red Army Regiment named after Bogun, the hero of the national liberation struggle waged by the Ukrainian people in the 17th century.)

Ignoring the woman's presence Salomyga cursed violently.

"So what are you doing here? Convalescing?"

"We'll have time to convalesce in the next world. They're pressing down pretty hard on us at the front."

The Commandant interrupted him, nodding toward the woman.

"We'll talk about that later."

Salomyga sat down heavily on a stool and removed his cap, which bore a cockade with an enamel trident, the emblem of the UNR (Ukrainian National Republic).

"Golub sent me," he began in a low tune. "A division of regulars is going to be transferred here soon. In general there's going to be some doings in town, and it's my job to put things straight. The 'Chief himself may come here with some foreign bigwig or other, so there's to be no talk about any 'diversions'. What're you writing?"

The Commandant shifted the cigarette to the other corner of his mouth.

"I've got a damn nuisance of a boy here. Remember that chap Zhukhrai, the one who stirred up the railway-men against us? Well, he was caught at the station."

"He was, eh? Go on," Salomyga pulled his stool closer.

"Well, that blockhead Omelchenko, the Station Commandant, sent him over escorted by a Cossack, and on the way the lad I've got in here took the prisoner away from him in broad daylight. The Cossack was disarmed and got his teeth knocked out, and was left to whistle for his prisoner. Zhukhrai got away, but we managed to grab this fellow. Here you have it all down on paper," and he pushed a sheaf of sheets covered with writing toward Salomyga.

The latter scanned through the report, turning over the sheets with his left hand.

When he had finished, he looked at the Commandant.

"And so you got nothing out of him?"

The Commandant pulled nervously at the peak of his cap.

"I've been at him for five days now, but all he says is, 'I don't know anything and I didn't free him.'

The young scoundrel! You see, the escort recognised him—practically choked the life out of him as soon as he saw him. I could hardly pull the fellow off—no wonder, he'd good reason to be sore because Omelchenko at the station had given him twenty-five strokes with the cleaning rod for losing his prisoner. There's no sense in keeping him any more, so I'm sending this off to headquarters for permission to finish him off."

Salomyga spat in disdain.

"If I had him he'd speak up sure enough. You're not much at conducting enquiries. Whoever heard of a theology student making a Commandant! Did you try the rod?"

The Commandant was furious.

"You're going a bit too far. Keep your sneers to yourself. I'm the Commandant here and I'll ask you not to interfere."

Salomyga looked at the bristling Commandant and roared with laughter.

"Ha-ha-ha. . . . Don't puff yourself up too much, priest's son, or you'll burst. To hell with you and your problems. Better tell me where a fellow can get a couple of bottles of samogon?"

The Commandant grinned.

"That s easy. "

"As for this," Salomyga jabbed at the sheaf of papers with his finger, "if you want to fix him properly put him down as eighteen years instead of sixteen. Round the top of six off like that.

Otherwise they mightn't pass it."

There were three of them in the storeroom. A bearded old man in a threadbare coat lay on his side on the bunk, his spindle legs in their wide linen trousers drawn up under him. He had been arrested because the horse of the Petlyura men billeted with him had been missing from the shed.

An elderly woman with small shifty eyes and a pointed chin was sitting on the floor. She made her living by selling samogon and had been thrown in here on a charge of stealing a watch and other valuables. Korchagin lay semiconscious in the corner under the window, his head resting on his crushed cap.

A young woman, in a peasant kerchief, her eyes wide with terror, was led into the storeroom.

She stood for a moment or two and then sat down next to the samogon woman.

"Got caught, eh, wench?" the latter spoke rapidly, inspecting the newcomer with curious eyes.

There was no answer, but the samogon woman would not give up.

"Why'd they pick you up, eh? Nothing to do with samogon by any chance?" The peasant girl got up and looked at the persistent "No, it's because of my brother," she replied quietly.

"And who's he?" the old woman persisted.

The old man spoke up.

"Why don't you leave her alone? She's got enough to worry about without your chattering."

The woman turned quickly toward the bunk.

"Who are you to tell me what to do? I'm not talking to you, am I?"

The old man spat.

"Leave her alone, I tell you."

Silence descended again on the storeroom. The peasant girl spread out a big shawl and lay down,resting her head on her arm.

The samogon woman began to eat. The old man sat up, lowered his feet onto the floor, slowly rolled himself a cigarette and lit it. Clouds of acrid smoke spread out.

"A person can't eat in peace with that stink," the woman grumbled, her jaws working busily.

"You've smoked the whole place up."

The old man returned with a sneer:

"Afraid of losing weight, eh? You won't be able to get through the door soon. Why don't you give the boy something to eat instead of stuffing it all into yourself?"

The woman made an angry gesture.

"I tried, but he doesn't want anything. And as for that you can keep your mouth shut—it's not your food I'm eating."

The girl turned to the samogon woman and, nodding toward Korchagin, asked:

"What is he in here for?"

The woman brightened up at being addressed and readily replied:

"He's a local lad—Korchagin's younger boy. His mother's a cook."

Leaning over to the girl, she whispered in her ear:

"He freed a Bolshevik—a sailor we had hereabouts .who used to lodge with my neighbour Zozulikha."

The young woman remembered the words, she had overheard: "I'm sending this off to headquarters for permission to finish him off."

One after the other troop trains pulled in at the junction, and battalions of regulars poured out in a disorderly mob. The armoured train Zaporozhets, four cars long, its steel sides ribbed with rivets,crawled along a side track. Guns were unloaded and horses were led out of closed box cars. The horses were saddled on the spot and mounted men jostled their way through the milling crowds of infantrymen to the station yard where the cavalry unit was lining up.

Officers ran up and down, calling the numbers of their units.

The station buzzed like a wasps' nest. Gradually the regular squares of platoons were hammered out of the shapeless mass of vociferous, swirling humanity and soon a stream of armed men was pouring into town. Until late in the evening carts creaked and rattled and the stragglers bringing up the rear of the rifle division trailed along the highway.

The procession finally ended with the headquarters company marching briskly by, bellowing from a hundred and twenty throats:

What's the shouting?

What's the noise?

It's Petlyura

And his boys

Come to town. .. .

Pavel Korchagin got up to look out of the window. Through the early twilight he could hear the rumbling of wheels on the street, the tramping of many feet, and the lusty singing.

Behind him a soft voice said:

"The troops have come to town."

Korchagin turned round.

The speaker was the girl who had been brought in the day before.

He had already heard her story—the samogon woman had wormed it out of her. She came from a village seven versts from the town, where her elder brother, Gritsko, now a Red partisan, had headed a poor peasants' committee when the Soviets were in power.

When the Reds left, Gritsko girded himself with a machine-gun belt and went with them. Now the family was being hounded incessantly. Their only horse had been taken away from them. The father had been imprisoned for a while and had a rough time of it. The village elder— one of those on whom Gritsko had clamped down—was always billeting strangers in their house, out of sheer spite. The family was destitute. And when the Commandant had come to the village the day before to make a search, the elder had brought him to the girl's place. She struck his fancy and the next morning he brought her to town with him "for interrogation".

Korchagin could not fall asleep, try as he might he could not find rest, and in his brain drilled one insistent thought which he could not dispel: "What next?"

His bruised body ached, for the guard had beaten him with bestial fury.

To escape the bitter thoughts crowding his mind he listened to the whispering of the two women.

In a barely audible voice the girl was telling how the Commandant had pestered her, how he had threatened and coaxed, and when she rebuffed him, turned on her in fury.

"I'll lock you up in a cellar and let you rot there," he had said.

Darkness lurked in the corners of the cell. There was another night ahead, a stifling, restless night.

It was the seventh night in captivity, but to Pavel it seemed that he had been there for months. The floor was hard, and pain racked his body. There were three of them now in the storeroom. The samogon woman had been released by the Khorunzhy to procure some vodka. Grandpa was snoring on the bunk as if he were at home on his Russian stove; he bore his misfortune with stoic calm and slept soundly through the night. Khristina and Pavel lay on the floor, almost side by side.

Yesterday Pavel had seen Sergei through the window—he had stood for a long time out in the street, looking sadly at the windows of the houses.

"He knows I'm here," Pavel had thought.

For three days running someone had brought sour black bread for him—who it was the guards would not tell. And for two days the Commandant had repeatedly questioned him.

What could it all mean?

During the questioning he had given nothing away; on the contrary he had denied everything.

Why he had kept silent, he did not know himself. He wanted to be brave and strong, like those of whom he had read in books, yet that night when he was being taken to prison and one of his captors had said, "What's the use of dragging him along, Pan Khorunzhy? A bullet in the back will fix him", he had been afraid. Yes, the thought of dying at sixteen was terrifying! Death was the end of everything. Khristina was also thinking. She knew more than the young man. Most likely he did not know yet what was in store for him . . . what she had overheard.

He tossed about restlessly at night unable to sleep. Khristina pitied him, though the prospect she herself faced was hardly better—she could not forget the menace of the Commandant's words: "I'll fix you up tomorrow— if you won't have me it's the guardhouse for you. The Cossacks will be glad to get you. So take your choice." Oh, how hard it was, and no mercy to be expected anywhere! Was it her fault that Gritsko had joined the Reds? How cruel life was!

A dull pain choked her and in the agony of helpless despair and fear her body was racked by soundless sobs. A shadow moved in the corner by the wall. "Why are you crying?"

In a passionate whisper Khristina poured out her woes to her silent cell mate. He did not speak,but laid his hand lightly on hers.

"They'll torture me to death, curse them," she whispered in terror, gulping down her tears.

"Nothing can save me." What could Pavel say to this girl? There was nothing to say. Life was crushing them both in an iron ring.

Perhaps he ought to put up a fight when they came for her tomorrow? They'd only beat him to death, or a sabre blow on the head would end it all. Wishing to comfort the distraught girl somehow, he stroked her hand tenderly. The sobbing ceased. At intervals the sentry at the entrance could be heard challenging a passer-by with the usual "Who goes there?" and then everything was quiet again. Grandpa was fast asleep. The interminable minutes crawled slowly by. Then, to his utter surprise, Pavel felt the girl's arms go around him and pull him toward her.

"Listen," hot lips were whispering, "there is no escape for me: if it isn't the officer, it'll be those others. Take me, love, so that dog won't be the first to have me."

"What are you saying, Khristina!"

But the strong arms did not release him. Full, burning lips pressed down on his—they were hard to escape. The girl's words were simple, tender—and he knew why she uttered them.

For a moment everything receded—the bolted door, the red-headed Cossack, the Commandant,the brutal beatings, the seven stifling, sleepless nights—all were forgotten, and only the burning lips and the face moist with tears existed.

Suddenly he remembered Tonya.

How could he forget her? Those dear, wonderful eyes.

He mustered his strength and broke away from Khristina's embrace. He staggered to his feet like a drunken man and seized hold of the grill. Khristina's hands found him.

"Why, what is the matter?"

All her heart was in that question. He bent down to her and pressing her hands said:

"I can't, Khristina. You are so . . . good." He hardly knew what he was saying.

He stood up again in the intolerable silence and went over to the bunk. Sitting down on the edge,he woke up the old man.

"Give me a smoke, please, Granddad."

The girl, huddled in her shawl, wept in the corner.

The next day the Commandant came with some Cossacks and took Khristina away. Her eyes sought Pavel's in farewell, and there was reproach in them. And when the door slammed behind her his soul was more desolate and dreary than ever.

All day long the old man could not get a word out of Pavel. The sentries and the Commandant's guard were changed. Toward evening a new prisoner was brought in. Pavel recognised him: it was Dolinnik, a joiner from the sugar refinery, a short thickset man wearing a faded yellow shirt under a threadbare jacket. He surveyed the storeroom with a keen eye.

Pavel had seen him in February 1917, when the reverberation of the revolution reached their town.

He had heard only one Bolshevik speak during the noisy demonstrations held then and that Bolshevik was Dolinnik. He had climbed onto a roadside fence and addressed the troops. Pavel remembered his closing words:

"Follow the Bolsheviks, soldiers, they will not betray you!"

He had not seen the joiner since.

Granddad was glad to have a new cell mate, for he obviously found it hard to sit silent all day long. Dolinnik settled down next to him on the edge of the bunk, smoked a cigarette with him and questioned him about everything.

Then the newcomer moved over to Korchagin. "Well, young man?" he asked Pavel. "And how did you get in here?"

Pavel replied in monosyllables and Dolinnik saw that it was caution that kept the young man from speaking. When he learned of the charge laid against Pavel his intelligent eyes widened with amazement and he sat down beside the lad.

"So you say you got Zhukhrai away? That's interesting. I didn't know they'd nabbed you."

Pavel, taken by surprise, raised himself on his elbow. "I don't know any Zhukhrai. They can pin anything on you here."

Dolinnik, smiling, moved closer to him. "That's all right, my boy. You don't need to be cautious with me. I know more than you do."

Quietly, so that the old man should not overhear he continued:

"I saw Zhukhrai off myself, he's probably reached his destination by now. He told me all about what happened." After a moment's pause, Dolinnik added: "I see you're made of the right stuff,boy. Though, the fact that they caught you and know everything is bad, Very bad, I should say."

He took off his jacket and spreading it on the floor sat down on it with his back against the wall,and began to roll another cigarette.

Dolinnik's last remark made everything clear to Pavel. There was no doubt about it, Dolinnik was all right. Besides, he had seen Zhukhrai off, and that meant. . . .

That evening he learned that Dolinnik had been arrested for agitation among Petlyura's Cossacks.

Moreover, he had been caught distributing an appeal issued by the gubernia revolutionary committee calling on the troops to surrender and go over to the Reds.

Dolinnik was careful not to tell Pavel much.

"Who knows," he thought to himself, "they may use the ramrod on the boy. He's still too young."

Late at night when they were settling themselves for sleep, he voiced his apprehensions in the brief remark:

"Well, Korchagin, we seem to be in a pretty bad fix. Let's see what will come of it."

The next day a new prisoner was brought in—the flop-eared, scraggy-necked barber Shlyoma Zeltser. 

"Fuchs, Bluvstein and Trachtenberg are going to welcome him with bread and salt," he told Dolinnik gesturing excitedly as he spoke. "I said that if they want to do that, they can, but will the rest of the Jewish population back them up? No, they won't, you can take it from me. Of course they have their own fish to fry. Fuchs has a store and Trachtenberg's got the flour mill. But what've I got? And the rest of the hungry lot? Nothing—paupers, that's what we are. Well, I've got a long tongue, and today when I was shaving an officer—one of the new ones who came recently —I said: 'Do you think Ataman Petlyura knows about these pogroms or not? Will he see the delegation?' Oi, how many times I've got into trouble through this tongue of mine. So what do you think this officer did when I had shaved him and powdered his face and done all in fine style too? He gets up and instead of paying me arrests me for agitating against the authorities." Zeltser struck his chest with his fist. "Now what sort of agitation was that? What did I say? I only asked the fellow. . . . And to lock me up for that. . . ." 

In his excitement Zeltser twisted a button on Dolinnik's shirt and tugged at his arms. 

Dolinnik smiled in spite of himself as he listened to the indignant Shlyoma. 

"Yes, Shlyoma," he said gravely when the barber had finished, "that was a stupid thing for a clever fellow like you to do. You chose the wrong time to let your tongue run away with you. I wouldn't have advised you to get in here." 

Zeltser nodded understandingly and made a gesture of despair with his hand. Just then the door opened and the samogon woman was pushed in. She staggered in, heaping foul curses on the Cossack who brought her. 

"You and your Commandant ought to be roasted on a slow fire! I hope he shrivels up and croaks from that booze of mine!" 

The guard slammed the door shut and they heard him locking it on the outside. 

As the woman settled down on the edge of the bunk the old man greeted her jocularly: 

"So you're back with us again, you old chatterbox? Sit down and make yourself at home." 

The samogon woman darted a hostile glance at him and picking up her bundle sat down on the floor next to Dolinnik. 

It turned out that she had been released just long enough for her captors to get some bottles of samogon out of her. 

Suddenly shouts and the sound of running feet could be heard from the guardroom next door. 

Somebody was barking out orders. The prisoners stopped talking to listen.

Strange things were happening on the square in front of the ungainly church with the ancient belfry. On three sides the square was lined with rectangles of troops—

units of the division of regular infantry mustered in full battle kit. 

In front, facing the entrance to the church, stood three regiments of infantry in squares placed in checkerboard fashion, their ranks buttressed against the school fence. 

This grey, rather dirty mass of Petlyura soldiers standing there with rifles at rest, wearing absurd Russian helmets like pumpkins cut in half, and heavily laden down with bandoliers, was the best division the "Directorate" had. 

Well-uniformed and shod from the stores of the former tsarist army and consisting mainly of kulaks who were consciously fighting the Soviets, the division had been transferred here to defend this strategically important railway junction. Five different railway lines converged at Shepetovka,and for Petlyura the loss of the junction would have meant the end of everything. As it was, the "Directorate" had very little territory left in its hands, and the small town of Vinnitsa was now Petlyura's capital.

The "Chief Ataman" himself had decided to inspect the troops and now everything was in readiness for his arrival.

Back in a far corner of the square where they were least likely to be seen stood a regiment of new recruits— barefoot youths in shabby civilian clothes of all descriptions. These were farm lads picked up from their beds by midnight raiding parties or seized on the streets, and none of them had the least intention of doing any fighting.

"Let them look for fools somewhere else," they said.

The most the Petlyura officers could do was to bring the recruits to town under escort, divide them into companies and battalions and issue them arms. The very next day, however, a third of the recruits thus herded together would disappear and with each passing day their numbers dwindled.

It would have been more than foolhardy to issue them boots, particularly since the boot stocks were far from plentiful. And so everyone was ordered to report for conscription shod. The result was an astonishing collection of dilapidated footwear tied on with bits of string and wire.

They were marched out for parade barefoot.

Behind the infantry stood Golub's cavalry regiment.

Mounted men held back the dense crowds of curious townsfolk who had come to see the parade.

After all, the "Chief Ataman" himself was to be present! Events like this were rare enough in town and no one wanted to miss the free entertainment it promised.

On the church steps were gathered the colonels and captains, the priest's two daughters, a handful of Ukrainian schoolteachers, a group of "free Cossacks", and the slightly hunchbacked mayor—in a word, the elite representing the "public", and among them the Inspector-General of Infantry wearing a Caucasian cherkesska. It was he who was in command of the parade.

Inside the church Vasili, the priest, was garbing himself in his Easter service vestments.

Petlyura was to be received in grand style. For one thing, the newly-mobilised recruits were to take the oath of allegiance, and for this purpose a yellow-and-blue flag had been brought out.

The Division Commander set out for the station in a rickety old Ford car to meet Petlyura.

When he had gone, the Inspector of Infantry called over Colonel Chernyak, a tall, well-built officer with a foppishly twirled moustache.

"Take someone along with you and see that the Commandant's office and the rear services are in proper shape. If you find any prisoners there look them over and get rid of the riffraff."

Chernyak clicked his heels, took along the first Cossack captain his eye lighted on and galloped off.

The Inspector turned politely to the priest's elder daughter.

"What about the banquet, everything in order?"

"Oh, yes. The Commandant's doing his best," she replied, gazing avidly at the handsome Inspector.

Suddenly a stir passed through the crowd: a rider was coming down the road at a mad gallop,bending low over the neck of his horse. He waved his hand and shouted:

"They're coming!"

"Fall in!" barked the Inspector.

The officers ran to their places.

As the Ford chugged up to the church the band struck up The Ukraine Lives On.

Following the Division Commander, the "Chief Ataman" heaved himself laboriously out of the car. Petlyura was a man of medium height, with a square head firmly planted on a red bull neck;he wore a blue tunic of fine wool cloth girded tight with a yellow belt to which a small Browning in a chamois holster was attached. On his head was a peaked khaki uniform cap with a cockade bearing the enamel trident.

There was nothing especially warlike about the figure of Simon Petlyura. As a matter of fact, he did not look like a military man at all.

He heard out the Inspector's report with an expression of displeasure on his face. Then the mayor addressed him in greeting.

Petlyura listened absently, staring at the assembled regiments over the mayor's head.

"Let us begin," he nodded to the Inspector.

Mounting the small platform next to the flag, Petlyura delivered a ten-minute speech to the troops.

The speech was unconvincing. Evidently tired from the journey, the Ataman spoke without enthusiasm. He finished to the accompaniment of the regulation shouts of "Slava!

Slava!" from the soldiers and climbed down from the platform dabbing his perspiring forehead with a handkerchief. Then, together with the Inspector and the Division Commander, he inspected the units.

As he passed the ranks of the newly-mobilised recruits his eyes narrowed in a disdainful scowl and he bit his lips in annoyance.

Toward the end of the inspection, when the platoons of new recruits marched in uneven ranks to the flag, where the priest Vasili was standing, Bible in hand, and kissed first the Bible and then the hem of the flag, an unforeseen incident occurred.

A delegation which had contrived by some unknown means to reach the square approached Petlyura. At the head of the group came the wealthy timber merchant Bluvstein with an offering of bread and salt, followed by Fuchs the draper, and three other well-to-do businessmen.

With a servile bow Bluvstein extended the tray to Petlyura. It was taken by an officer standing alongside.

"The Jewish population wishes to express its sincere gratitude and respect for you, the head of the state. Please accept this address of greeting."

"Good," muttered Petlyura, quickly scanning the sheet of paper.

Fuchs stepped forward.

"We most humbly beg you to allow us to open our enterprises and we ask for protection against pogroms." Fuchs stumbled over the last word.

An angry scowl darkened Petlyura's features.

"My army does not engage in pogroms. You had better remember that."

Fuchs spread out his arms in a gesture of resignation.

Petlyura's shoulder twitched nervously. The untimely appearance of the delegation irritated him.

He turned to Golub, who was standing behind chewing his black moustache.

"Here's a complaint against your Cossacks, Pan Colonel. Investigate the matter and take measures accordingly," said Petlyura. Then, addressing the Inspector, he said dryly:

"You may begin the parade."

The ill-starred delegation had not expected to run up against Golub and they hastened to withdraw.

The attention of the spectators was now wholly absorbed by the preparations for the ceremonial march-past. Sharp commands were rapped out.

Golub, his features outwardly calm, walked over to Bluvstein and said in a loud whisper:

"Get out of here, you rotten heathens, or I'll make mincemeat out of you!"

The band struck up and the first units marched through the square. As they drew alongside Petlyura, the troops bellowed a mechanical "Slava!" and then swung down the highway to disappear into the sidestreets. At the head of the companies, uniformed in brand-new khaki outfits,the officers marched at an easy gait as if they were simply taking a stroll, swinging their swagger sticks. The swagger stick mode, like cleaning rods for the soldiers, had just been introduced in the division.

The new recruits brought up the rear of the parade. They came in a disorderly mass, out of step and jostling one another.

There was a low rustle of bare feet as the mobilised men shuffled by, prodded on by the officers who worked hard but in vain to bring about some semblance of order.

When the second company was passing a peasant lad in a linen shirt on the side nearest the reviewing stand gaped in such wide-eyed amazement at the "Chief" that he stepped into a hole in the road and fell flat on the ground. His rifle slid over the cobblestones with a loud clatter. He tried to get up but was knocked down again by the men behind him.

Some of the spectators burst out laughing. The company broke ranks and passed through the square in complete disorder. The luckless lad picked up his rifle and ran after the others.

Petlyura turned away from this sorry spectacle and walked over to the car without waiting for the end of the review. The Inspector, who followed him, asked diffidently:

"Pan the Ataman will not stay for dinner?"

"No," Petlyura flung back curtly.

Sergei Bruzzhak, Valya and Klimka were watching the parade in the crowd of spectators pressed against the high fence surrounding the church. Sergei, gripping the bars of the grill, looked at the faces of the people below him with hatred in his eyes.

"Let's go, Valya, they've shut up shop," he said in a deliberately loud defiant voice, and turned away from the fence. People stared at him in astonishment.

Ignoring everyone, he walked to the gate, followed by his sister and Klimka.

Colonel Chernyak and the Captain galloped up to the Commandant's office and dismounted.

Leaving the horses in the charge of a dispatch rider they strode rapidly into the guardhouse.

"Where's the Commandant?" Chernyak asked the dispatch rider sharply.

"Dunno," the man stammered. "Gone off somewhere.''

Chernyak looked around the filthy, untidy room, the unmade beds and the Cossacks of the Commandant's guard who sprawled on them and made no attempt to rise when the officers entered.

"What sort of a pigsty is this?" Chernyak roared. "And who gave you permission to wallow about like hogs?" he lashed at the men lying flat on their backs.

One of the Cossacks sat up, belched and growled:

"What're you squawking for? We've got our own squawker here."

"What!" Chernyak sprang toward the man. "Who do you think you're talking to, you bastard? I'm Colonel Chernyak. D'you hear, you swine! Up, all of you, or I'll have you flogged!" The enraged Colonel dashed about the guardhouse. "I'll give you one minute to sweep out the filth, straighten out the bedding and make your filthy mugs presentable. You look like a band of brigands, not Cossacks!"

Beside himself with rage, the Colonel violently kicked at a slop pail obstructing his path.

The Captain was no less violent, and, adding emphasis to his curses by wielding his three-thonged whip, drove the men out of their bunks.

"The Chief Ataman's reviewing the parade. He's liable to drop in here any minute. Get a move on there!"

Seeing that things were taking a serious turn and that they really might be in for a flogging—they knew Chernyak's reputation well enough—the Cossacks sprang into feverish activity.

In no time work was in full swing.

"We ought to have a look at the prisoners," the Captain suggested. "There's no telling whom they've got locked up here. Might be trouble if the Chief looks in."

"Who has the key?" Chernyak asked the sentry. "Open the door at once."

A Sergeant jumped up and opened the lock.

"Where's the Commandant? How long do you think I'm going to wait for him? Find him at once and send him in here," Chernyak ordered. "Muster the guard in the yard! Why are the rifles without bayonets?"

"We only took over yesterday," the Sergeant tried to explain, and hurried off in search of the Commandant.

The Captain kicked the storeroom door open. Several of the people inside got up from the floor,the others remained motionless.

"Open the door wider," Chernyak commanded. "Not enough light here."

He scrutinised the prisoners' faces.

"What are you in for?" he snapped at the old man sitting on the edge of the bunk.

The old man half rose, hitched up his trousers and, frightened by the sharp order, mumbled:

"Dunno myself. They just locked me up and here I am. There was a horse disappeared from the yard, but I've got nothing to do with it."

"Whose horse?" the Captain interrupted him.

"An army horse, of course. My billets sold him and drank the proceeds and now they're blaming me."

Chernyak ran his eye swiftly over the old man and with an impatient jerk of his shoulder shouted:

"Pick up your things and get out of here!" Then he turned to the samogon woman.

The old man could not believe his ears. Blinking his shortsighted eyes, he turned to the Captain:

"Does that mean I can go?"

The Cossack nodded as much as to say: the faster you get out the better.

Hurriedly the old man seized his bundle which hung over the edge of the bunk and dashed through the door.

"And what are you in for?" Chernyak was questioning the samogon woman.

Swallowing the mouthful of pie she had been chewing, the woman rattled off a ready answer:

"It's an injustice it is that I should be in here, Pan Chief. Just think of it, to drink a poor widow's samogon and then lock her up."

"You're not in the samogon business, are you?" Chernyak asked.

"Business? Nothing of the kind," said the woman with an injured air. "The Commandant came and took four bottles and didn't pay a kopek. That's how it is: they drink your booze and never pay.

You wouldn't call that business, would you?"

"Enough. Now go to the devil!"

The woman did not wait for the order to be repeated. She picked up her basket and backed to the door, bowing in gratitude.

"May God bless you with good health, your honours."

Dolinnik watched the comedy with frank amazement.

None of the prisoners could make out what it was all about. The only thing that was clear was that the arrivals were chiefs of some kind who had the power to dispose of them as they saw fit.

"And you there?" Chernyak spoke to Dolinnik.

"Stand up when Pan the Colonel speaks to you!" barked the Captain.

Slowly Dolinnik raised himself to his feet from the floor.

"What are you in for?" Chernyak repeated.

Dolinnik looked at the Colonel's neatly twirled moustache, at his clean-shaven face, looked at the peak of his new cap with the enamel cockade, and a wild thought flashed through his mind:

Maybe it'll work!

"I was arrested for being out on the streets after eight o'clock," he said, blurting out the first thing that came into his head.

He awaited the answer in an agony of suspense.

"What were you doing out at night?"

"It wasn't night, only about eleven o'clock."

He no longer believed that this shot in the dark would succeed.

His knees trembled when he heard the brief command:

"Get out."

Dolinnik walked hurriedly out of the door, forgetting his jacket; the Captain was already questioning the next prisoner.

Korchagin was the last to be interrogated. He sat on the floor' completely dumbfounded by the proceedings. At first he could not believe that Dolinnik had been released. Why were they letting everyone off like this? But Dolinnik . . . Dolinnik had said that he had been arrested for breaking the curfew. . . . Then it dawned upon him.

The Colonel began questioning the scraggy Zeltser with the usual "What are you in for?"

The barber, pale with nervousness, blurted out:

"They tell me I was agitating, but I don't know what they're talking about."

Chernyak pricked up his ears.

"What's that? Agitation? What were you agitating about?"

Zeltser spread out his arms in bewilderment.

"I don't know myself, I only said that they were collecting signatures to a petition to the Chief Ataman for the Jewish population."

"What sort of petition?" both Chernyak and the Captain moved menacingly toward Zeltser.

"A petition asking that pogroms be prohibited. You know, we had a terrible pogrom. The whole population's afraid.

"That's enough," Chernyak interrupted him. "We'll give you a petition you won't forget, you dirty Jew." Turning to the Captain, he snapped: "Put this one away properly.

Have him taken to headquarters—I'll talk to him there personally. We'll see who's behind this petition business."

Zeltser tried to protest but the Captain struck him sharply across the back with his riding crop.

"Shut up, you bastard!"

His face twisted with pain, Zeltser staggered back into a corner. His lips trembled and he barely restrained his sobs.

While this was going on, Pavel rose to his feet. He was now the only prisoner besides Zeltser in the storeroom.

Chernyak stood in front of the boy and inspected him with his piercing black eyes.

"Well, what are you doing here?"

Pavel had his answer ready.

"I cut off a saddle skirt for soles," he said quickly.

("What saddle?" the Colonel asked.

"We've got two Cossacks billeted at our place and I cut off a bit of an old saddle to sole my boots with. So the Cossacks hauled me in here." Seized by a wild hope to regain his freedom, he added:

"I didn't know it wasn't allowed. . . ."

The Colonel eyed Pavel with disgust.

"Of all the things this Commandant thought of, blast him! Look at the prisoners he picked up!" As he turned to the door, he shouted: "You can go home, and tell your father to give you the thrashing you deserve. Out with you!"

Still unable to believe his ears, Pavel snatched up Dolinnik's jacket from the floor and rushed for the door, his heart pounding as if it would burst. He ran through the guardroom and slipped outside behind the Colonel who was walking out into the yard. In a moment Pavel was through the wicket gate and in the street.

The unlucky Zeltser remained alone in the storeroom. He looked round with harassed eyes,instinctively took a few steps towards the exit, but just then a sentry entered the guardhouse,closed the door, inserted the padlock, and sat down on a stool next to the door.

Out on the porch Chernyak, much pleased with himself, said to the Captain:

"It's a good thing we looked in. Think of the rubbish we found there—we'll have to lock up that Commandant for a couple of weeks. Well, it's time we were going."

The Sergeant had mustered his detail in the yard. When he saw the Colonel, he ran over and reported:

"Everything's in order, Pan Colonel."

Chernyak inserted a boot into a stirrup and sprang lightly into the saddle. The Captain was having some trouble with his restive horse. Reining in his mount, the Colonel said to the Sergeant:

"Tell the Commandant I cleared out all the rubbish he'd collected in there. And tell him I'll give him two weeks in the guardhouse for the way he ran things here. As for the fellow in there now,transfer him to headquarters at once. Let the guard be in readiness."

"Very good, Pan Colonel," said the Sergeant and saluted.

Spurring on their horses, the Colonel and the Captain galloped back to the square where the parade was already coming to an end.

Pavel swung himself over another fence and stopped exhausted. He could go no farther. Those days cooped up in the stifling storeroom without food had sapped his strength.

Where should he go? Home was out of the question, and to go to the Bruzzhaks might bring disaster upon the whole family if anyone discovered him there.

He did not know what to do, and ran on again blindly, leaving behind the vegetable patches and back gardens at the edge of the town. Colliding heavily with a fence, he came to himself with a start and looked about him in amazement: there behind the tall fence was the forest warden's garden. So this was where his weary legs had brought him! He could have sworn that he had had no thought of coming this way. How then did he happen to be here? For that he could find no answer.

Yet rest awhile he must; he had to consider the situation and decide on the next step. He remembered that there was a summerhouse at the end of the garden. No one would see him there.

Hoisting himself to the top of the fence, he clambered over and dropped into the garden below.

With a brief glance at the house, barely visible among the trees, he made for the summerhouse. To his dismay he found that it was open on nearly all sides. The wild vine that had walled it in during the summer had withered and now all was bare.

He turned to go back, but it was too late. There was a furious barking behind him. He wheeled round and saw a huge dog coming straight at him down the leaf-strewn path leading from the house. Its fierce growls rent the stillness of the garden.

Pavel made ready to defend himself. The first attack he repulsed with a heavy kick. But the animal crouched to spring a second time. There is no saying how the encounter would have ended had a familiar voice not called out: "Come here, Tresor! Come here!"

Tonya came running down the path. She dragged Tresor back by the collar and turned to address the young man standing by the fence.

"What are you doing here? You might have been badly mauled by the dog. It's lucky I. . . ."

She stopped short and her eyes widened in surprise. How extraordinarily like Korchagin was this stranger who had wandered into her garden.

The figure by the fence stirred.

"Tonya!" said the young man softly. "Don't you recognise me?"

Tonya cried out and rushed impulsively over to him.

"Pavel, you?"

Tresor, taking the cry as a signal for attack, sprang forward.

"Down, Tresor, down!" A few cuffs from Tonya and he slunk back with an injured air toward the house, his tail between his legs.

"So you're free?" said Tonya, clinging to Pavel's hands.

"You knew then?"

"I know everything," replied Tonya breathlessly. "Liza told me. But however did you get here?

Did they let you go?"

"Yes, but only by mistake," Pavel replied wearily. "I ran away. I suppose they're looking for me now. I really don't know how I got here. I thought I'd rest a bit in your summerhouse. I'm awfully tired," he added apologetically.

She gazed at him for a moment or two and a wave of pity and tenderness swept over her.

"Pavel, my darling Pavel," she murmured holding his hands fast in hers. "I love you. . . . Do you hear me? My stubborn boy, why did you go away that time? Now you're coming to us, to me. I shan't let you go for anything. It's nice and quiet in our house and you can stay as long as you like."

Pavel shook his head.

"What if they find me here? No, I can't stay in your place."

Her hands squeezed his fingers and her eyes flashed.

"If you refuse, I shall never speak to you again. Artem isn't here, he was marched off under escort to the locomotive. All the railwaymen are being mobilised. Where will you go?"

Pavel shared her anxiety, and only his fear of bringing trouble to this girl now grown so dear to him held him back. But at last, worn out by his harrowing experiences, hungry and exhausted, he gave in.

While he sat on the sofa in Tonya's room, the following conversation ensued between mother and daughter in the kitchen.

"Mama, Korchagin is in my room. He was my pupil, you remember? I don't want to hide anything from you. He was arrested for helping a Bolshevik sailor to escape. Now he has run away from prison, but he has nowhere to go." Her voice trembled. "Mother dear, please let him stay here for a while."

The mother looked into her daughter's pleading eyes.

"Very well, I have no objection. But where do you intend to put him?"

Tonya flushed.

"He can sleep in my room on the sofa," she said. "We needn't tell Papa anything for the time being."

Her mother looked straight into her eyes.

"Is this what you have been fretting about so much lately?" she asked.

"Yes."

"But he is scarcely more than a boy."

"I know," replied Tonya, nervously fingering the sleeve of her blouse. "But if he hadn't escaped they would have shot him just the same."

Yekaterina Mikhailovna was alarmed by Korchagin's presence in her home. His arrest and her daughter's obvious infatuation with a lad she scarcely knew disturbed her.

But Tonya, considering the matter settled, was already thinking of attending to her guest's comfort.

"He must have a bath, first thing, Mama. I'll see to it at once. He is as dirty as a chimney sweep. It must be ages since he had a wash."

And she bustled off to heat the water for the bath and find some clean linen for Pavel. When all was ready she rushed into the room, seized Pavel by the arm and hurried him off to the bathroom without more ado.

"You must have a complete change of clothes. Here is a suit for you to put on. Your things will have to be washed. You can wear that in the meantime," she said pointing to the chair where a blue sailor blouse with striped white collar and a pair of bell-bottomed trousers were neatly laid out.

Pavel looked surprised. Tonya smiled.

"I wore it at a masquerade ball once," she explained. "It will be just right for you. Now, hurry.

While you're washing, I'll get you something to eat."

She went out and shut the door, leaving Pavel with no alternative but to undress and climb into the tub.

An hour later all three, mother, daughter and Pavel, were dining in the kitchen.

Pavel, who was ravenously hungry, consumed three helpings before he was aware of it. He was rather shy of Yekaterina Mikhailovna at first but soon thawed out when he saw how friendly she was.

After dinner they retired to Tonya's room and at Yekaterina Mikhailovna's request Pavel related his experiences.

"What do you intend doing now?" Yekaterina Mikhailovna asked when he had finished.

Pavel pondered the question a moment. "I should like to see Artem first, and then I shall have to get away from here."

"But where will you go?"

"I think I could make my way to Uman or perhaps to Kiev. I don't know myself yet, but I must get away from here as soon as possible."

Pavel could hardly believe that everything had changed so quickly. Only that morning he had been in the filthy cell and now here he was sitting beside Tonya, wearing clean clothes, and, what was most important, he was free.

What queer turns life can take, he thought: one moment the sky seems black as night, and then the sun comes shining through again. Had it not been for the danger of being arrested again he would have been the happiest lad alive at this moment.

But he knew that even in this large, silent house he was far from safe. He must go away from here,it did not matter where. And yet he did not at all welcome the idea of going away. How thrilling it had been to read about the heroic Garibaldi! How he had envied him! But now he realised that Garibaldi's must have been a hard life, hounded as he was from place to place. He, Pavel, had only lived through seven days of misery and torment, yet it had seemed like a whole year.

No, clearly he was not cut out to be a hero.

"What are you thinking about?" Tonya asked, bending over toward him. The deep blue of her eyes seemed fathomless.

"Tonya, shall I tell you about Khristina?"

"Yes, do," Tonya urged him.

He told her the sad story of his fellow-captive.

The clock ticked loudly in the silence as he ended his story: ".. .And that was the last we saw of her," his words came with difficulty. Tonya's head dropped and she had to bite her lips to force back the tears.

Pavel looked at her. "1 must go away tonight," he said with finality.

"No, no, 1 shan't let you go anywhere tonight."

She stroked his bristly hair tenderly with her slim warm fingers. . . .

"Tonya, you must help me. Someone must go to the station and find out what has happened to Artem and take a note to Seryozha. I have a revolver hidden in a crow's nest.

I daren't go for it, but Seryozha can get it for me. Will you be able to do this for me?"

Tonya got up.

"I'll go to Liza Sukharko right away. She and I will go to the station together. Write your note and I'll take it to Seryozha. Where does he live? Shall I tell him where you are if he should want to see you?"

Pavel considered for a moment before replying. "Tell him to bring the gun to your garden this evening."

It was very late when Tonya returned. Pavel was fast asleep. The touch of her hand awoke him and he opened his eyes to find her standing over him, smiling happily.

"Artem is coming here soon. He has just come back. Liza's father has agreed to vouch for him and they're letting him go for an hour. The engine is standing at the station. I couldn't tell him you are here. I just told him I had something very important to tell him. There he is now!"

Tonya ran to open the door. Artem stood in the doorway dumb with amazement, unable to believe his eyes. Tonya closed the door behind him so that her father, who was lying ill with typhus in the study, might not overhear them.

Another moment and Artem was giving Pavel a bear's hug that made his bones crack, and crying:

"Pavel! My little brother!"

And so it was decided: Pavel was to leave the next day. Artem would arrange for Bruzzhak to take him on a train bound for Kazatin.

Artem, usually grave and reserved, was now almost beside himself with joy at having found his brother after so many days of anxiety and uncertainty.

"Then it's settled. Tomorrow morning at five you'll be at the warehouse. While they're loading on fuel you can slip in. I wish I could stay and have a chat with you but I must be getting back. I'll see you off tomorrow. They're making up a battalion of railwaymen. We go about under an armed escort just like when the Germans were here."

Artem said good-bye to his brother and left.

Dusk gathered fast, Sergei would be arriving soon with the revolver. While he waited, Pavel paced nervously up and down the dark room. Tonya and her mother were with the forest warden.

He met Sergei in the darkness by the fence and the two friends shook hands warmly. Sergei had brought Valya with him. They conversed in low tones.

"I haven't brought the gun," Sergei said. "That backyard of yours is thick with Petlyura men. There are carts standing all over the place and they had a bonfire going.

So I couldn't climb the tree to get the gun. It's a damn shame." Sergei was much put out.

"Never mind," Pavel consoled him. "Perhaps it's just as well. It would be worse if I happened to be caught on the way with the gun. But make sure you get hold of it."

Valya moved closer to Pavel.

"When are you leaving?"

"Tomorrow, at daybreak."

"How did you manage to get away? Tell us."

In a rapid whisper Pavel told them his story. Then he took leave of his comrades. The jolly Sergei was unusually silent.

"Good luck, Pavel, don't forget us," Valya said in a choking voice.

And with that they left him, the darkness swallowing them up in an instant.

Inside the house all was quiet. The measured ticking of the clock was the only sound in the stillness.

For two of the house's inmates there was no thought of sleep that night. How could they sleep when in six hours they were to part, perhaps never to meet again. Was it possible in that brief space of time to give utterance to the myriad of unspoken thoughts that seethed within them?

Youth, sublime youth, when passion, as yet unknown, is only dimly felt in a quickening of the pulse; when your hand coming in chance contact with your sweetheart's breast trembles as if affrighted and falters, and when the sacred friendship of youth guards you from the final step!

What can be sweeter than to feel her arm about your neck and her burning kiss on your lips.

It was the second kiss they had exchanged throughout their friendship. Pavel, who had experienced many a beating but never a caress except from his mother, was stirred to the depths of his being. Hitherto life had shown him its most brutal side, and he had not known it could be such a glorious thing; now this girl had taught him what happiness could mean.

He breathed the perfume of her hair and seemed to see her eyes in the darkness.

"I love you so, Ton

Pary One Chapter 7
---

For a whole week the town, belted with trenches and enmeshed in barbed-wire entanglements,went to sleep at night and woke up in the morning to the pounding of guns and the rattle of rifle fire. Only in the small hours would the din subside, and even then the silence would be shattered from time to time by bursts of fire as the outposts probed out each other. At dawn men busied themselves around the battery at the railway station. The black snout of a gun belched savagely and the men hastened to feed it another portion of steel and explosive. Each time a gunner pulled at a lanyard the earth trembled underfoot. Three versts from town the shells whined over the village occupied by the Reds, drowning out all other sounds, and sending up geysers of earth.

The Red battery was stationed on the grounds of an old Polish monastery standing on a high hill in the centre of the village.

The Military Commissar of the battery, Comrade Zamostin, leapt to his feet. He had been sleeping with his head resting on the trail of a gun. Now, tightening his belt with the heavy Mauser attached to it, he listened to the flight of the shell and waited for the explosion. Then the courtyard echoed to his resonant voice.

"Time to get up, Comrades!"

The gun crews slept beside their guns, and they were on their feet as quickly as the Commissar.

All but Sidorchuk, who raised his head reluctantly and looked around with sleep-heavy eyes.

"The swine—hardly light yet and they're at it again. Just out of spite, the bastards!"

Zamostin laughed.

"Unsocial elements, Sidorchuk, that's what they are. They don't care whether you want to sleep or not."

The artilleryman grumblingly roused himself.

A few minutes later the guns in the monastery yard were in action and shells were exploding in the town.

On a platform of planks rigged up on top of the tall smoke stack of the sugar refinery squatted a Petlyura officer and a telephonist. They had climbed up the iron ladder inside the chimney.

From this vantage point they directed the fire of their artillery. Through their field glasses they could see every movement made by the Red troops besieging the town.

Today the Bolsheviks were particularly active. An armoured train was slowly edging in on the Podolsk Station, keeping up an incessant fire as it came. Beyond it the attack lines of the infantry could be seen. Several times the Red forces tried to take the town by storm, but the Petlyura troops were firmly entrenched on the approaches. The trenches erupted a squall of fire, filling the air with a maddening din which mounted to an unintermittent roar, reaching its highest pitch during the attacks. Swept by this leaden hailstorm, unable to stand the inhuman strain, the Bolshevik lines fell back, leaving motionless bodies behind on the field. 

Today the blows delivered at the town were more persistent and more frequent than before. The air quivered from the reverberations of the gunfire. From the height of the smoke stack you could see the steadily advancing Bolshevik lines, the men throwing themselves on the ground only to rise again and press irresistibly forward. Now they had all but taken the station. The Petlyura division's available reserves were sent into action, but they could not close the breach driven in their positions.

Filled with a desperate resolve, the Bolshevik attack lines spilled into the streets adjoining the station, whose defenders, the third regiment of the Petlyura division, routed from their last positions in the gardens and orchards at the edge of the town by a brief but terrible thrust, scattered into the town. Before they could recover enough to make a new stand, the Red Army men poured into the streets, sweeping away in bayonet charges the Petlyura pickets left behind to cover the retreat. 

Nothing could induce Sergei Bruzzhak to stay down in the basement where his family and the nearest neighbours had taken refuge. And in spite of his mother's entreaties be climbed out of the chilly cellar. An armoured car with the name Sagaidachny on its side clattered past the house, firing wildly as it went. Behind it ran panic-stricken Petlyura men in complete disorder. One of them slipped into Sergei's yard, where with feverish haste he tore off his cartridge belt, helmet and rifle and then vaulted over the fence and disappeared in the kitchen gardens beyond. Sergei looked out into the street. Petlyura soldiers were running down the road leading to the Southwestern Station, their retreat covered by an armoured car. The highway leading to town was deserted. Then a Red Army man dashed into sight. He threw himself down on the ground and began firing down the road. A second and a third Red Army man came into sight behind him. . . . Sergei watched them coming, crouching down and firing as they ran. A bronzed Chinese with bloodshot eyes, clad in an undershirt and girded with machine-gun belts, was running full height, a grenade in each hand. And ahead of them all came a Red Army man, hardly more than a boy, with a light machine gun. The advance guard of the Red Army had entered the town. Sergei, wild with joy, dashed out onto the road and shouted as loud as he could: 

"Long live the comrades!" 

So unexpectedly did he rush out that the Chinese all but knocked him off his feet. The latter was about to turn on him, but the exultation on Sergei's face stayed him. 

"Where is Petlyura?" the Chinese shouted at him, panting heavily. 

But Sergei did not hear him. He ran back into the yard, picked up the cartridge belt and rifle abandoned by the Petlyura man and hurried after the Red Army men. They did not notice him until they had stormed the Southwestern Station. Here, after cutting off several trainloads of munitions and supplies and hurling the enemy into the woods, they stopped to rest and regroup. 

The young machine gunner came over to Sergei and asked in surprise: 

"Where are you from, Comrade?" 

"I'm from this town. I've been waiting for you to come." 

Sergei was soon surrounded by Red Army men. 

"I know him," the Chinese said in broken Russian. "He yelled 'Long live comrades!' He Bolshevik, he with us, a good fellow!" he added with a broad smile, slapping Sergei on the shoulder approvingly. 

Sergei's heart leapt with joy. He had been accepted at once, accepted as one of them. And togetherwith them he had taken the station in a bayonet charge.

The town bestirred itself. The townsfolk, exhausted by their ordeal, emerged from the cellars and basements and came out to the front gates to see the Red Army units enter the town. Thus it was that Sergei's mother and his sister Valya saw Sergei marching along with the others in the ranks of the Red Army men. He was hatless, but girded with a cartridge belt and with a rifle slung over his shoulder.

Antonina Vasilievna threw up her hands in indignation.

So her Seryozha had got mixed up in the fight. He would pay for this! Fancy him parading with a rifle in front of the whole town! There was bound to be trouble later on. Antonina Vasilievna could no longer restrain herself:

"Seryozha, come home this minute!" she shouted. "I'll show you how to behave, you scamp! I'll teach you to fight!" And at that she marched out to the road with the firm intention of bringing her son back.

But this time her Seryozha, her boy whose ears she had so often boxed, looked sternly at his mother, his face burning with shame and anger as he snapped at her: "Stop shouting! I'm staying where I am." And he marched past without stopping.

Antonina Vasilievna was beside herself with anger.

"So that's how you treat your mother! Don't you dare come home after this!"

"I won't!" Sergei cried, without turning around.

Antonina Vasilievna stood speechless on the road staring after him, while the ranks of weather beaten, dust-covered fighting men trudged past.

"Don't cry, mother! We'll make your laddie a commissar," a strong, jovial voice rang out. A roar of good-natured laughter ran through the platoon. Up at the head of the company voices struck up in unison:

Comrades, the bugles are sounding,

Shoulder your arms for the fray.

On to the kingdom of liberty

Boldly shall we fight our way. . . .

The ranks joined in a mighty chorus and Sergei's ringing voice merged in the swelling melody. He had found a new family. One bayonet in it was his, Sergei's.

On the gates of the Leszczinski house hung a strip of white cardboard with the brief inscription:

"Revcom." Beside it was an arresting poster of a Red Army man looking into your eyes and pointing his finger straight at you over the words: "Have you joined the Red Army?"

The Political Department people had been at work during the night putting up these posters all over the town. Nearby hung the Revolutionary Committee's first proclamation to the toiling population of Shepetovka:

"Comrades! The proletarian troops have taken this town. Soviet power has been restored. We call on you to maintain order. The bloody cutthroats have been thrown back, but if you want them never to return, if you want to see them destroyed once and for all, join the ranks of the Red Army. Give all your support to the power of the working folk. Military authority in this town is in 

the hands of the chief of the garrison. Civilian affairs will be administered by the Revolutionary Committee. 

"Signed: Dolinnik "Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee." 

People of a new sort appeared in the Leszczinski house. The word "comrade", for which only yesterday people had paid with their life, was now heard on all sides. That indescribably moving word, "comrade"! 

For Dolinnik there was no sleep or rest these days. The joiner was busy establishing revolutionary government. 

In a small room on the door of which hung a slip of paper with the pencilled words "Party Committee" sat Comrade Ignatieva, calm and imperturbable as always. The Political Department entrusted her and Dolinnik with the task of setting up the organs of Soviet power. 

One more day and office workers were seated at desks and a typewriter was clicking busily. A Commissariat of Supplies was organised under nervous, dynamic Tyzycki. Now that Soviet power was firmly established in the town, Tyzycki, formerly a mechanic's helper at the local sugar refinery, proceeded with grim determination to wage war on the bosses of the sugar refinery who, nursing a bitter hatred for the Bolsheviks, were lying low and biding their time. 

At a meeting of the refinery workers he summed up the situation in harsh, unrelenting terms. 

"The past is gone never to return," he declared, speaking in Polish and banging his fist on the edge of the rostrum to drive home his words. "It is enough that our fathers and we ourselves slaved all our lives for the Potockis. We built palaces for them and in return His Highness the Count gave us just enough to keep us from dying of starvation. 

"How many years did the Potocki counts and the Sanguszko princes ride our backs? Are there not any number of Polish workers whom Potocki ground down just as he did the Russians and Ukrainians? And yet the count's henchmen have now spread the rumour among these very same workers that the Soviet power will rule them all with an iron hand. 

"That is a foul lie, Comrades! Never have workingmen of different nationalities had such freedom as now. All proletarians are brothers. As for the gentry, we are going to curb them, you may depend on that." His hand swung down again heavily on the barrier of the rostrum. "Who is it that has made brothers spill each other's blood? For centuries kings and nobles have sent Polish peasants to fight the Turks. They have always incited one nation against another. Think of all the bloodshed and misery they have caused! And who benefited by it all? But soon all that will stop. 

This is the end of those vermin. The Bolsheviks have flung out a slogan that strikes terror into the hearts of the bourgeoisie: 'Workers of all countries, unite!' There lies our salvation, there lies our hope for a better future, for the day when all workingmen will be brothers. Comrades, join the Communist Party! 

"There will be a Polish republic too one day but it will be a Soviet republic without the Potockis, for they will be rooted out and we shall be the masters of Soviet Poland. You all know Bronik Ptaszinski, don't you? The Revolutionary Committee has appointed him commissar of our factory. 

'We were naught, we shall be all.' We shall have cause for rejoicing, Comrades. Only take care not to give ear to the hissing of those hidden reptiles! Let us place our faith in the workingman's cause and we shall establish the brotherhood of all peoples throughout the world!"

These words were uttered with a sincerity and fervour that came from the bottom of this simple workingman's heart. He descended the platform amid shouts of enthusiastic acclaim from the younger members of the audience. The older workers, however, hesitated to speak up. Who knew but what tomorrow the Bolsheviks might have to give up the town and then those who remained would have to pay dearly for every rash word. Even if you escaped the gallows, you would lose your job for sure.

The Commissar of Education, the slim, well-knit Czarnopyski, was so far the only schoolteacher in the locality who had sided with the Bolsheviks.

Opposite the premises of the Revolutionary Committee the Special Duty Company was quartered;its men were on duty at the Revolutionary Committee. At night a Maxim gun stood ready in the garden at the entrance to the Revcom, a sinewy ammunition belt trailing from its breech. Two men with rifles stood guard beside it.

Comrade Ignatieva on her way to the Revcom went up to one of them, a young Red Army man,and asked:

"How old are you, Comrade?"

"Going on seventeen."

"Do you live here?"

The Red Army man smiled. "Yes, I only joined the army the day before yesterday during the fighting."

Ignatieva studied his face.

"What does your father do?"

"He's an engine driver's assistant."

At that moment Dolinnik appeared, accompanied by a man in uniform.

"Here you are," said Ignatieva, turning to Dolinnik, "I've found the very lad to put in charge of the district committee of the Komsomol. He's a local man."

Dolinnik glanced quickly at Sergei—for it was he.

"Ah yes. You're Zakhar's boy, aren't you? All right, go ahead and stir up the young folk."

Sergei looked at them in surprise. "But what about the company?"

"That's all right, we'll attend to that," Dolinnik, already mounting the steps, threw over his shoulder.

Two days later the local committee of the Young Communist League of the Ukraine was formed.

Sergei plunged into the vortex of the new life that had burst suddenly and swiftly upon the town. It filled his entire existence so completely that he forgot his family although it was so near at hand.

He, Sergei Bruzzhak, was now a Bolshevik. For the hundredth time he pulled out of his pocket the document issued by the Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, certifying that he, Sergei,was a Komsomol and Secretary of the Komsomol Committee. And should anyone entertain any doubts on that score there was the impressive Mannlicher—a gift from dear old Pavel—in its makeshift canvas holster hanging from the belt of his tunic. A most convincing credential that!

Too bad Pavlushka wasn't around!

Sergei's days were spent on assignments given by the Revcom. Today too Ignatieva was waiting for him. They were to go down to the station to the Division Political Department to get newspapers and books for the Revolutionary Committee. Sergei hurried out of the building to the street, where a man from the Political Department was waiting for them with an automobile. 

During the long drive to the station where the Headquarters and Political Department of the First Soviet Ukrainian Division were located in railway carriages, Ignatieva plied Sergei with questions. 

"How has your work been going? Have you formed your organisation yet? You ought to persuade your friends, the workers' children, to join the Komsomol. We shall need a group of Communist youth very soon. Tomorrow we shall draw up and print a Komsomol leaflet. Then we'll hold a big youth rally in the theatre. When we get to the Political Department I'll introduce you to Ustinovich. She is working with the young people, if I'm not mistaken." 

Ustinovich turned out to be a girl of eighteen with dark bobbed hair, in a new khaki tunic with a narrow leather belt. She gave Sergei a great many pointers in his work and promised to help him. 

Before he left she gave him a large bundle of books and newspapers, including one of particular importance, a booklet containing the programme and rules of the Komsomol. 

When he returned late that night to the Revcom Sergei found Valya waiting for him outside, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" she cried. "What do you mean by staying away from home like this? Mother is crying her eyes out and father is very angry with you. There's going to be an awful row. 

"No, there isn't," he reassured her. "I haven't any time to go home, honest I haven't. I won't be coming tonight either. But I'm glad you've come because I want to have a talk with you. Let's go inside." 

Valya could hardly recognise her brother. He was quite changed. He fairly bubbled with energy. 

As soon as she was seated Sergei went straight to the point. 

"Here's the situation, Valya. You've got to join the Komsomol. You don't know what that is? The Young Communist League. I'm running things here. You don't believe me?

All right, look at this!" 

Valya read the paper and looked at her brother in bewilderment. 

"What will I do in the Komsomol?" 

Sergei spread out his hands. "My dear girl, there's heaps to do! Look at me, I'm so busy I don't sleep nights. We've got to make propaganda. Ignatieva says we're going to hold a meeting in the theatre soon and talk about the Soviet power. She says I'll have to make a speech. I think it's a mistake because I don't know how to make speeches. I'm bound to make a hash of it. Now, what about your joining the Komsomol?" 

"I don't know what to say. Mother would be wild with me if I did." 

"Never mind mother, Valya," Sergei urged. "She doesn't understand. All she cares about is to have her children beside her. But she has nothing against the Soviet power.

On the contrary, she's all for it. But she would rather other people's sons did the fighting. Now, is that fair? Remember what Zhukhrai told us? And look at Pavel, he didn't stop to think about his mother. The time has come when we young folk must fight for our right to make something of our lives. Surely you won't refuse, Valya?

Think how fine it will be. You could work with the girls, and I would be working with the fellows. That reminds me, I'll tackle that red-headed devil Klimka this very day. Well, Valya, what do you say? Are you with us or not? I have a little booklet here that will tell you all about it." 

He took the booklet of Komsomol Rules out of his pocket and handed it to her. 

"But what if Petlyura comes back again?" Valya asked him in a low voice, her eyes glued to her brother's face.

This thought had not yet occurred to Sergei and he pondered it for a moment.

"I would have to leave with all the others, of course," he said. "But what would happen to you?

Yes, it would make mother very unhappy." He lapsed into silence.

"Seryozha, couldn't you enrol me without mother or anyone else knowing? Just you and me? Icould help just the same. That would be the best way."

"I believe you're right, Valya."

Ignatieva entered the room at that point.

"This is my little sister Valya, Comrade Ignatieva. I've just been talking to her about joining theKomsomol. She would make a suitable member, but you see, our mother might make difficulties.

Could we enrol Valya so that no one would know about it? You see, we might have to give up the town. I would leave with the army, of course, but Valya is afraid it would go hard with mother."

Ignatieva, sitting on the edge of a chair, listened gravely.

"Yes," she agreed. "That is the best course."

The packed theatre buzzed with the excited chatter of the youth who had come in response to notices posted all over town. A brass band of workers from the sugar refinery was playing. The audience, consisting mainly of students of the local secondary school and Gymnasium, was less interested in the meeting than in the concert that was to follow it.

At last the curtain rose and Comrade Razin, Secretary of the Uyezd Committee, who had just arrived, appeared on the platform.

All eyes were turned to this short, slenderly built man with the small, sharp nose, and his speech was listened to with keen attention. He told them about the struggle that had swept the entire country and called on youth to rally to the Communist Party. He spoke like an experienced orator but made excessive use of terms like "orthodox Marxists", "social-chauvinists" and the like, which his hearers did not understand. Nevertheless, when he finished they applauded him warmly, and after introducing the next speaker, who was Sergei, he left.

It was as he had feared: now that he was face to face with the audience, Sergei did not know what to say. He fumbled painfully for a while until Ignatieva came to his rescue by whispering from her seat on the platform: "Tell them about organising a Komsomol cell."

Sergei at once went straight to the point.

"Well, Comrades, you've heard all there is to be said. What we've got to do now is to form a cell.

Who is in favour?"

A hush fell on the gathering. Ustinovich stepped into the breach. She got up and told the audience how the youth were being organised in Moscow. Sergei in the meantime stood aside in confusion.

He raged inwardly at the meeting's reaction to the question of organising a cell and he scowled down at the audience. They hardly listened to Ustinovich. Sergei saw Zalivanov whisper something to Liza Sukharko with a contemptuous look at the speaker on the platform. In the front row the senior Gymnasium girls with powdered faces were casting coy glances about them and whispering among themselves. Over in the corner near the door leading backstage was a group of young Red Army men. Among them Sergei saw the young machine gunner. He was sitting on the edge of the stage fidgeting nervously and gazing with undisguised hatred at the flashily dressed

Liza Sukharko and Anna Admovskaya who, totally unabashed, were carrying on a lively conversation with their escorts. 

Realising that no one was listening to her, Ustinovich quickly wound up her speech and sat down. 

Ignatieva took the floor next, and her calm compelling manner quelled the restless audience. 

"Comrades," she said, "I advise each of you to think over what has been said here tonight. I am sure that some of you will become active participants in the revolution and not merely spectators. 

The doors are open to receive you, the rest is up to you. We should like to hear you express your opinion. We invite anyone who has anything to say to step up to the platform." 

Once more silence reigned in the hall. Then a voice spoke up from the back. 

"I'd like to speak!" 

Misha Levchukov, a lad with a slight squint and the build of a young bear, made his way to the stage. 

"The way things are," he said, "we've got to help the Bolsheviks. I'm for it. Seryozhka knows me. 

I'm joining the Komsomol." 

Sergei beamed. He sprang forward to the centre of .the stage. 

"You see, Comrades!" he cried. "I always said Misha was one of us: his father was a switchman and he was crushed by a train, and that's why Misha couldn't get an education. But he didn't need to go to Gymnasium to understand what's wanted at a time like this." 

There was an uproar in the hall. A young man with carefully groomed hair asked for the floor. It was Okushev, a Gymnasium student and the son of the local apothecary.

Tugging at his tunic, he began: 

"I beg your pardon, Comrades. I don't understand what is wanted of us. Are we expected to go in for politics? If so, when are we going to study? We've got to finish the Gymnasium. If it was some sports society, or club that was being organised where we could gather and read, that would be another matter. But to go in for politics means taking the risk of getting hanged afterwards. Sorry, but I don't think anybody will agree to that." 

There was laughter in the hall as Okushev jumped off the stage and resumed his seat. The next speaker was the young machine gunner. Pulling his cap down over his forehead with a furious gesture and glaring down at the audience, he shouted: 

"What're you laughing at, you vermin!" 

His eyes were two burning coals and he trembled all over with fury. Taking a deep breath he began: 

"Ivan Zharky is my name. I'm an orphan. I never knew my mother or my father and I never had a home. I grew up on the street, begging for a crust of bread and starving most of the time. It was a dog's life, I can tell you, something you mama's boys know nothing about. Then the Soviet power came along and the Red Army men picked me up and took care of me. A whole platoon of them adopted me. They gave me clothes and taught me to read and write. But what's most important,

they taught me what it was to be a human being. Because of them I became a Bolshevik and I'll be a Bolshevik till I die. I know damn well what we're fighting for, we're fighting for us poor folk, for the workers' government. You sit there cackling but you don't know that two hundred comrades were killed fighting for this town. They perished. . . ." Zharky's voice vibrated like a taut string. 

"They gave up their lives gladly for our happiness, for our cause. . . . People are dying all over the country, on all the fronts, and you're playing at merry-go-rounds here. Comrades," he went on, turning suddenly to the presidium table, "you're wasting your time talking to them there," he jabbed a finger toward the hall. "Think they'll understand you? No! A full stomach is no comrade to an empty one. Only one man came forward here and that's because he's one of the poor, an orphan. Never mind," he roared furiously at the gathering, "we'll get along without you. We're not going to beg you to join us, you can go to the devil, the lot of you! The only way to talk to the likes of you is with a machine gun!" And with this parting thrust he stepped off the stage and made straight for the exit, glancing neither to right nor left. 

None of those who had presided at the meeting stayed on for the concert. 

"What a mess!" said Sergei with chagrin as they were on their way back to the Revcom. "Zharky was right. We couldn't do anything with that Gymnasium crowd. It just makes you wild!" "It's not surprising," Ignatieva interrupted him. "After all there were hardly any proletarian youth there at all. Most of them were either sons of the petty bourgeois or local intellectuals—philistines all of them. You will have to work among the sawmill and sugar refinery workers. But that meeting was not altogether wasted. You'll find there are some very good comrades among the students." 

Ustinovich agreed with Ignatieva. 

"Our task, Seryozha," she said, "is to bring home our ideas, our slogans, to everyone. The Party will focus the attention of all working people on every new event. We shall hold many meetings, conferences and congresses. The Political Department is opening a summer theatre at the station. 

A propaganda train is due to arrive in a few days and then we'll get things going in real earnest. 

Remember what Lenin said—we won't win unless we draw the masses, the millions of working people into the struggle." 

Late that evening Sergei escorted Ustinovich to the station. On parting he clasped her hand firmly and held it a few seconds longer than absolutely necessary. A faint smile flitted across her face. 

On his way back Sergei dropped in to see his people. He listened in silence to his mother's scolding, but when his father chimed in, Sergei took up the offensive and soon had Zakhar Vasilievich at a disadvantage. 

"Now listen, dad, when you went on strike under the Germans and killed that sentry on the locomotive, you thought of your family, didn't you? Of course you did. But you went through with it just the same because your workingman's conscience told you to. I've also thought of the family. 

I know very well that if we retreat you folks will be persecuted because of me. But I couldn't sit at home anyway. You know how it is yourself, dad, so why all this fuss? I'm working for a good cause and you ought to back me up instead of kicking up a row. Come on, dad, let's make it up and then ma will stop scolding me too." He regarded his father with his clear blue eyes and smiled affectionately, confident that he was in the right. 

Zakhar Vasilievich stirred uneasily on the bench and through his thick bristling moustache and untidy little beard his yellowish teeth showed in a smile. 

"Dragging class consciousness into it, eh, you young rascal? You think that revolver you're sporting is going to stop me from giving you a good hiding?" 

But his voice held no hint of anger, and mastering his confusion, he held out his horny hand to his son. "Carry on, Seryozha. Once you've started up the gradient I'll not be putting on the brakes. But you mustn't forget us altogether, drop in once in a while."

It was night. A shaft of light from a crack in the door lay on the steps. Behind the huge lawyer's desk in the large room with its upholstered plush furniture sat five people: Dolinnik, Ignatieva, Cheka chief Timoshenko, looking like a Kirghiz in his Cossack fur cap, the giant railwayman Shudik and flat-nosed Ostapchuk from the railway yards. A meeting of the Revcom was in progress. 

Dolinnik, lea'ning over the table and fixing Ignatieva with a stern look, hammered out hoarsely: 

"The front must have supplies. The workers have to eat. As soon as we came the shopkeepers and market profiteers raised their prices. They won't take Soviet money. Old tsarist money or Kerensky notes are the only kind in circulation here. Today we must sit down and work out fixed prices. We know very well that none of the profiteers are going to sell their goods at the fixed price. They'll hide what they've got. In that case we'll make searches and confiscate the bloodsuckers' goods. This is no time for niceties. We can't let the workers starve any longer. 

Comrade Ignatieva warns us not to go too far. That's the reaction of a fainthearted intellectual, if you ask me. Now don't take offence, Zoya, I know what I'm talking about. And in any case it isn't a matter of the petty traders. I have received information today that Boris Zon, the innkeeper, has a secret cellar in his house. Even before Petlyura came, the big shopown-ers had huge stocks of goods hidden away there." He paused to throw a sly, mocking glance at Timoshenko. 

"How did you find that out?" queried Timoshenko, surprised and annoyed at Dolinnik's having stolen a march on the Cheka. 

Dolinnik chuckled. "I know everything, brother. Besides finding out about the cellar, I happen to know that you and the Division Commander's chauffeur polished off half a bottle of samogon between you yesterday." 

Timoshenko fidgeted in his chair and a flush spread over his sallow features. 

"Good for you!" he exclaimed in unwilling admiration. But catching sight of Ignatieva's disapproving frown, he went no further. "That blasted joiner has his own Cheka!"

he thought to himself as he eyed the Chairman of the Revcom. 

"Sergei Bruzzhak told me," Dolinnik went on. "He knows someone who used to work in the refreshment bar. Well, that lad heard from the cooks that Zon used to supply them with all they needed in unlimited quantities. Yesterday Sergei found out definitely about that cellar. All that has to be done now is to locate it. Get the boys on the job, Timoshenko, at once. Take Sergei along. If we're lucky we'll be able to supply the workers and the division." 

Half an hour later eight armed men entered the innkeeper's home. Two remained outside to guard the entrance. 

The proprietor, a short stout man as round as a barrel, with a wooden leg and a face covered with a bristly growth of red hair, met the newcomers with obsequious politeness. 

"What do you wish at this late hour, Comrades?" he inquired in a husky bass. Behind Zon, stood his daughters in hastily donned dressing-gowns, blinking in the glare of Timoshenko's torch. From the next room came the sighs and groans of Zon's buxom wife who was hurriedly dressing. 

"We've come to search the house," Timoshenko explained curtly. 

Every square inch of the floor was thoroughly examined. A spacious barn piled high with sawn wood, several pantries, the kitchen and a roomy cellar—all were inspected with the greatest care. 

But not a trace of the secret cellar was found. 

In a tiny room off the kitchen the servant girl lay fast asleep. She slept so soundly that she did nothear them come in. Sergei wakened her gently.

"You work here?" he asked. The bewildered sleepy-eyed girl drew the blanket over her shouldersand shielded her eyes from the light.

"Yes," she replied. "Who are you?"

Sergei told her and, instructing her to get dressed, left the room.

In the spacious dining room Timoshenko was questioning the innkeeper who spluttered and fumed in great agitation:

"What do you want of me? I haven't got any more cellars. You're just wasting your time, I assure you. Yes, I did keep a tavern once but now I'm a poor man. The Petlyura crowd cleaned me out and very nearly killed me too. I am very glad the Soviets have come to power, but all I own is here for you to see." And he spread out his short pudgy hands, the while his bloodshot eyes darted from the face of the Cheka chief to Sergei and from Sergei to the corner and the ceiling.

Timoshenko bit his lips.

"So you won't tell, eh? For the last time I order you to show us where that cellar is."

"But, Comrade Officer, we've got nothing to eat ourselves," the innkeeper's wife wailed. "They've taken all we had." She tried to weep but nothing came of it.

"You say you're starving, but you keep a servant," Sergei put in.

"That's not a servant. She's just a poor girl we've taken in because she has nowhere to go. She'll tell you that herself."

Timoshenko's patience snapped. "All right then," he shouted, "now we'll set to work in earnest!"

Morning dawned and the search was still going on. Exasperated after thirteen hours of fruitless efforts, Timoshenko had already decided to abandon the quest when Sergei, on the point of leaving the servant girl's room he had been examining, heard the girl's faint whisper behind him:

"Look inside the stove in the kitchen."

Ten minutes later the dismantled Russian stove revealed an iron trapdoor. And within an hour a two-ton truck loaded with barrels and sacks drove away from the innkeeper's house now surrounded by a crowd of gaping onlookers.

Maria Yakovlevna Korchagina came home one hot day carrying her small bundle of belongings.

She wept bitterly when Artem told her what had happened to Pavel. Her life now seemed empty and dreary. She had to look for work, and after a time she began taking in washing from Red Army men who arranged for her to receive soldiers' rations by way of payment.

One evening she heard Artem's footsteps outside the window sounding more hurried than usual.

He pushed the door open and announced from the threshold: "I've brought a letter from Pavka."

"Dear Brother Artem," wrote Pavel. "This is to let you know that I am alive although not altogether well. I got a bullet in my hip but I am getting better now. The doctor says the bone is uninjured. So don't worry about me, I'll be all right. I may get leave after I'm discharged from hospital and I'll come home for a while. I didn't manage to get to mother's. I joined the cavalry brigade commanded by Comrade Kotovsky, whom I'm sure you've heard about because he's famous for his bravery. I have never seen anyone like him before and I have the greatest respect for him. Has mother come home yet? If she has, give her my best love. Forgive me for all the

trouble I have caused you. Your brother Pavel.

"Artem, please go to the forest warden's and tell them about this letter."

Maria Yakovlevna shed many tears over Pavel's letter. The scatterbrained lad had not even given the address of his hospital.

Sergei had become a frequent visitor at the green railway coach down at the station bearing the sign: "Agitprop Div. Pol. Dept." In one of the compartments of the Agitation and Propaganda Coach, Ustinovich and Ignatieva had their office. The latter, with the inevitable cigarette between her lips, smiled knowingly whenever he appeared.

The Secretary of the Komsomol District Committee had grown quite friendly with Rita Ustinovich, and besides the bundles of books and newspapers, he carried away with him from the station a vague sense of happiness after every brief encounter with her.

Every day the open-air theatre of the Division Political Department drew big audiences of workers and Red Army men. The agit train of the Twelfth Army, swathed in bright coloured posters, stood on a siding, seething with activity twenty-four hours a day. A printing plant had been installed inside and newspapers, leaflets and proclamations poured out in a steady stream. The front was near at hand.

One evening Sergei chanced to drop in at the theatre and found Rita there with a group of Red Army men. Late that night, as he was seeing her home to the station where the Political Department staff was quartered, he blurted out: "Why do I always want to be seeing you, Comrade Rita?" And added: "It's so nice to be with you! After seeing you I always feel I could go on working without stopping."

Rita halted. "Now look here, Comrade Bruzzhak," she said, "let's agree here and now that you won't ever wax lyrical any more. I don't like it."

Sergei blushed like a reprimanded schoolboy.

"I didn't mean anything," he said, "I thought we were friends . . . I didn't say anything counter revolutionary, did I? Very well, Comrade Ustinovich, I shan't say another word!"

And leaving her with a hasty handshake he all but ran back to town.

Sergei did not go near the station for several days. When Ignatieva asked him to come he refused on the grounds that he was too busy. And indeed he had plenty to do.

One night someone fired at Comrade Shudik as he was going home through a street inhabited mainly by Poles who held managerial positions at the sugar refinery. The searches that followed brought to light weapons and documents belonging to a Pilsudski organisation known as the Strelets.

A meeting was held at the Revcom. Ustinovich, who was present, took Sergei aside and said in a calm voice: "So your philistine vanity was hurt, was it? You're letting personal matters interfere with your work? That won't do, Comrade."

And so Sergei resumed his visits to the green railway coach.

He attended a district conference and participated in the heated debates that lasted for two days.

On the third day he went off with the rest of the conference delegates to the forest beyond the river and spent a day and a night fighting bandits led by Zarudny, one of Petlyura's officers still at large.

On his return he went to see Ignatieva and found Ustinovich there. Afterwards he saw her home to the station and on parting held her hand tightly. She drew it away angrily. Again Sergei kept away from the agitprop coach for many days and avoided seeing Rita even on business. And when she would demand an explanation of his behaviour he would reply curtly: "What's the use of talking to you? You'll only accuse me of being a philistine or a traitor to the working class or something."

Trains carrying the Caucasian Red Banner Division pulled in at the station. Three swarthy-complexioned commanders came over to the Revcom. One of them, a tall slim man wearing a belt of chased silver, went straight up to Dolinnik and demanded one hundred cartloads of hay. "No argument now," he said shortly, "I've got to have that hay. My horses are dying."

And so Sergei was sent with two Red Army men to get hay. In one village they were attacked by a band of kulaks. The Red Army men were disarmed and beaten unmercifully.

Sergei got off lightly because of his youth. All three were carted back to town by people from the Poor Peasants'Committee.

An armed detachment was sent out to the village and the hay was delivered the following day.

Not wishing to alarm his family, Sergei stayed at Ignatieva's place until he recovered. Rita Ustinovich came to visit him there and for the first time she pressed Sergei's hand with a warmth and tenderness he himself would never have dared to show.

One hot afternoon Sergei dropped in at the agit coach to see Rita. He read her Pavel's letter and told her something about his friend. On his way out he threw over his shoulder: "I think I'll go to the woods and take a dip in the lake."

Rita looked up from her work. "Wait for me. I'll come with you."

The lake was as smooth and placid as a mirror. Its warm translucent water exuded an inviting freshness.

"Wait for me over by the road. I'm going in," Rita ordered him.

Sergei sat down on a boulder by the bridge and lifted his face to the sun. He could hear her splashing in the water behind him.

Presently through the trees he caught sight of Tonya Tumanova and Chuzhanin, the Military Commissar of the agit train, coming down the road arm-in-arm. Chuzhanin, in his well-made officer's uniform with its smart leather belt and numberless straps and leather shiny top-boots, cut a dashing figure. He was in earnest conversation with Tonya.

Sergei recognised Tonya as the girl who had brought him the note from Pavel. She too looked hard at him as they approached. She seemed to be trying to place him. When they came abreast of him Sergei took Pavel's last letter out of his pocket and went up to her.

"Just a moment, Comrade. I have a letter here which concerns you partly."

Pulling her hand free Tonya took the letter. The slip of paper trembled slightly in her hand as she read.

"Have you had any more news from him?" she asked, handing the letter back to Sergei.

"No," he replied.

At that moment the pebbles crunched under Rita's feet and Chuzhanin, who had been unaware of her presence, bent over and whispered to Tonya: "We'd better go."

But Rita's mocking, scornful voice stopped him.

"Comrade Chuzhanin! They've been looking for you over at the train all day."

Chuzhanin eyed her with dislike.

"Never mind," he said surlily. "They'll manage without me.

Rita watched Tonya and the Military Commissar go.

"It's high time that good-for-nothing was sent packing!" she observed dryly.

The forest murmured as the breeze stirred the mighty crowns of the oaks. A delicious freshness was wafted from the lake. Sergei decided to go in.

When he came back from his swim he found Rita sitting on a treetrunk not far from the road. They wandered, talking, into the depths of the woods. In a small glade with tall thick grass they paused to rest. It was very quiet in the forest. The oaks whispered to one another. Rita threw herself down on the soft grass and clasped her hands under her head. Her shapely legs in their old patched boots were hidden in the tall grass.

Sergei's eye chanced to fall on her feet. He noticed the neatly patched boots, then looked down at his own boot with the toe sticking out of a hole, and he laughed.

"What are you laughing at?" she asked.

Sergei pointed to his boot. "How are we going to fight in boots like these?"

Rita did not reply. She was chewing a blade of grass and her thoughts were obviously elsewhere.

"Chuzhanin is a poor Communist," she said at last. "All our political workers go about in rags but he thinks of nobody but himself. He does not belong in our Party. . .

. As for the front, the situation there is really very serious. Our country has a long and bitter fight before it." She paused,then added, "We shall have to fight with both words and rifles, Sergei. Have you heard about the Central Committee's decision to draft one-fourth of the Komsomol into the army? If you ask me,Sergei, we shan't be here long."

Listening to her, Sergei was surprised to detect a new note in her voice. With her black limpideyes upon him, he was ready to throw discretion to the winds and tell her that her eyes were like mirrors, but he checked himself in time.

Rita raised herself on her elbow. "Where's your revolver?"

Sergei fingered his belt ruefully. "That kulak band took it away from me."

Rita put her hand into the pocket of her tunic and brought out a gleaming automatic pistol.

"See that oak, Sergei?" she pointed the muzzle at a furrowed trunk about twenty-five paces from where they lay. And raising the weapon to the level of her eyes she fired almost without taking aim. The splintered bark showered down.

"See?" she said much pleased with herself and fired again. And again the bark splintered and fell in the grass.

"Here," she handed him the weapon with a mocking smile. "Now let's see what you can do."

Sergei muffed one out of three shots. Rita smiled condescendingly. "I thought you'd do worse."

She put down the pistol and lay down on the grass. Her tunic stretched tightly over her firm breasts.

"Sergei," she said softly. "Come here."

He moved closer.

"Look at the sky. See how blue it is. Your eyes are that colour. And that's bad. They ought to be grey, like steel. Blue is much too soft a colour."

And suddenly clasping his blond head, she kissed him passionately on the lips.

Two months passed. Autumn arrived.

Night crept up stealthily, enveloping the trees in its dark shroud. The telegraphist at Division Headquarters bent over his apparatus which was ticking out Morse and, gathering up the long narrow ribbon that wound itself snakily beneath his fingers, rapidly translated the dots and dashes into words and phrases:

"Chief of Staff First Division Copy to Chairman Revcom Shepetovka. Evacuate all official institutions in town within ten hours after receipt of this wire. Leave one battalion in town at disposal of commander of X. regiment in command sector of front. Division Headquarters,Political Department, all military institutions to be moved to Baranchev station. Report execution of order to Division Commander.

"(Signed)"

Ten minutes later a motorcycle was hurtling through the slumbering streets of the town, its headlight stabbing the darkness. It stopped, spluttering, outside the gates of the Revcom. The rider hurried inside and handed the telegram to the chairman Dolinnik. At once the place was seething with activity. The Special Duty Company lined up. An hour later carts loaded with Revcom property were rumbling through the town to the Podolsk Station where it was loaded into railway cars.

When he learned the contents of the telegram Sergei ran out after the motorcyclist.

"Can you give me a lift to the station, Comrade?" he asked the rider.

"Climb on behind, but mind you hold on fast."

A dozen paces from the agit coach which had already been attached to the train Sergei saw Rita.

He seized her by the shoulders and, conscious that he was about to lose something that had become very dear to him, he whispered: "Good-bye, Rita, dear comrade! We'll meet again sometime. Don't forget me."

To his horror he felt the tears choking him. He must go at once. Not trusting himself to speak, he wrung her hand until it hurt.

Morning found the town and station desolate and deserted. The last train had blown its whistle as if in farewell and pulled out, and now the rearguard battalion which had been left behind took up positions on either side of the tracks.

Yellow leaves fluttered down from the trees leaving the branches bare. The wind caught the fallen leaves and sent them rustling along the paths.

Sergei in a Red Army greatcoat, with canvas cartridge belts slung over his shoulders, occupied the crossing opposite the sugar refinery with a dozen Red Army men. The Poles were approaching.

Avtonom Petrovich knocked at the door of his neighbour Gerasim Leontievich. The latter, not yet dressed, poked his head out of the door.

"What's up?"

Avtonom Petrovich pointed to the Red Army men moving down the street, and winked: "They're

clearing out."

Gerasim Leontievich looked at him with a worried air: "What sort of emblem do the Poles have,do you know?"

"A single-headed eagle, I believe."

"Where the devil can you find one?"

Avtonom Petrovich scratched his head in consternation.

"It's all right for them," he said after a moment or two of reflection. "They just get up and go. But you have to worry your head about getting in right with the new authorities."

The rattle of a machine gun tore into the silence. An engine whistle sounded from the station and a gun boomed from the same quarter. A heavy shell bored its way high into the air with a loud whine and fell on the road beyond the refinery, enveloping the roadside shrubs in a cloud of bluesmoke. Silent and grim, the retreating Red Army troops marched through the street, turning frequently to look back as they went.

A tear rolled down Sergei's cheek. Quickly he wiped it away, glancing furtively at his comrades to make sure that no one had seen it. Beside Sergei marched Antek Klopotowski, a lanky sawmill worker. His finger rested on the trigger of his rifle. Antek was gloomy and preoccupied. His eyes met Sergei's, and he burst out:

"They'll come down hard on our folks, especially mine because we're Poles. You, a Pole, they'll say, opposing the Polish Legion. They're sure to kick my old man out of the sawmill and flog him.

I told him to come with us, but he didn't have the heart to leave the family. Hell, I can't wait to get my hands on those accursed swine!" And Antek angrily pushed back the helmet that had slipped down over his eyes.

. . .Farewell, dear old town, unsightly and dirty though you are with your ugly little houses and your crooked roads. Farewell, dear ones, farewell. Farewell, Valya and the comrades who have remained to work in the underground. The Polish Whiteguard legions, brutal and merciless, are approaching.

Sadly the railway workers in their oil-stained shirts watched the Red Army men go.

"We'll be back, Comrades!" Sergei cried out with aching heart.

舍佩托夫卡四周到处是战壕，到处是带刺的铁丝网。整整一个星期，这座小城都是在隆隆的炮声和清脆的枪声中醒来和入睡的。只是到了夜深的时候，才安静下来。偶尔有一阵慌乱的射击声划破夜空的沉寂，那是敌对双方的暗哨在互相试探。天刚亮，车站上的炮位周围就又忙碌起来。大炮张着黑色的嘴，又凶狠地发出可怖的吼叫声。人们急急忙忙往炮膛里装新的炮弹。炮手把发火栓一拉，大地便颤动起来。炮弹嘶嘶地呼啸着，飞向三俄里外红军占据的村庄，落下去，发出震耳欲聋的爆炸声，把巨大的土块掀到空中。

红军的炮队驻扎在一座古老的波兰修道院的院子里，修道院坐落在村中心的高岗上。

炮队政委扎莫斯京同志翻身跳了起来。他刚才枕着炮架睡了一觉。他紧了紧挂着沉甸甸的毛瑟枪的腰带，仔细倾听着炮弹的呼啸声，等待它爆炸。院子里响起了他那洪亮的喊声：“同志们，明天再接着睡吧！现在起床。起——床——！”

炮手们都睡在大炮跟前。他们和政委一样迅速地跳起来。

只有西多尔丘克一个人磨磨蹭蹭，他懒洋洋地抬起睡昏的头，说：“这帮畜生，天刚亮就呜呜乱叫，真是坏透了！”

扎莫斯京大笑起来：“哎，西多尔丘克，敌人真不自觉，也不考虑一下你还没睡够。”

西多尔丘克爬起来，不满意地嘟哝着。

几分钟之后，修道院里的大炮怒吼起来，炮弹在城里爆炸了。佩特留拉部队在糖厂那座高烟囱上搭了一个瞭望台，上面有一个军官和一个电话兵。

他们是攀着烟囱里的铁梯爬上去的。

整个城市的情况历历在目，就像在手掌上一样。他们从这里指挥炮兵发射。围城红军的每个行动他们都看得清清楚楚。今天布尔什维克军队非常活跃。用蔡斯望远镜可以看到红军各个部队运动的情况。一列装甲火车一边打炮，一边顺着铁轨缓慢地开向波多尔斯克车站。后面是步兵散兵线。红军几次发起进攻，想夺取这个小城，但是谢乔夫师的部队隐蔽在近郊的战壕里，固守着。战壕里喷射出凶猛的火焰，四周全是疯狂的射击。每次进攻，枪炮声都异常密集，汇成了一片怒吼。布尔什维克部队冒着弹雨进攻，后来支持不住，退却了，战场上留下了不动的尸体。

今天，对这座城市的攻击一次比一次顽强，一次比一次猛烈。空气在隆隆的炮声中震荡。从糖厂的烟囱上可以看到，布尔什维克的战士们时而匍匐在地，时而跌倒又爬起来，不可阻挡地向前推进。他们马上就要全部占领车站了。谢乔夫师把所有的预备队都投入了战斗，还是没有堵住车站上已被打开的缺口。奋不顾身的布尔什维克战士已经冲进了车站附近的街道。守卫车站的谢乔夫师第三团的士兵，遭到短促而猛烈的攻击之后，从设在城郊花园和菜地的最后防线上溃退下来，凌乱地朝城里狼狈逃窜。红军部队不给敌人喘息的机会，继续挺进，用刺刀开路，扫清了敌人的零星阻击部队，占领了所有街道。

谢廖沙一家和他们的近邻都躲在地窖里，但是，现在任何力量也不能迫使他再呆在这里了。他非常想到上面去看看。

尽管母亲再三阻拦，他还是从阴冷的地窖里跑了出来。一辆“萨盖达奇内号”装甲车隆隆地从他家房前急速驰过，一面逃，一面胡乱向四周射击。一群惊恐的佩特留拉败兵跟在装甲车后面逃跑。有个匪兵跑进了谢廖沙家的院子，慌慌张张地扔掉身上的子弹带、钢盔和步枪，跳过栅栏，钻进菜园子，不见了。谢廖沙决心到街上去看看。佩特留拉的败兵正沿着通往西南车站的大路逃窜，一辆装甲车在后面掩护他们。通往城里的公路上，一个人也没有。这时，突然有一个红军战士跳上了公路。他卧倒在地，顺着公路朝前打了一枪。紧接着出现了第二个、第三个……谢廖沙看见他们弯着腰，边追赶，边打枪。一个晒得黝黑、两眼通红的中国人，只穿一件衬衣，身上缠着机枪子弹带，两手攥着手榴弹，根本不找掩蔽物，一个劲猛追过来。跑在最前面的是一个非常年轻的红军战士，端着一挺轻机枪。这是打进城里的第一支红军队伍。谢廖沙高兴极了。他奔到公路上，使劲地喊了起来：“同志们万岁！”

他出现得太突然了，那个中国人差点把他撞倒。中国人正要向他猛扑上去，但是看到这个年轻人这样兴奋激动，就停住了。

“佩特留拉的，跑到哪里去了？”中国人气喘吁吁地冲着他喊道。

但是，谢廖沙已经顾不上听他的。他迅速跑进院子，抓起逃兵扔下的子弹带和步枪，追赶红军队伍去了。他和这支队伍一起冲进了西南车站，直到这个时候，红军战士们才注意到他。他们截住了好几列满载弹药和军需品的火车，把敌人赶进了树林，停下来整顿队伍。这时，那个年轻的机枪手走到谢廖沙跟前，惊讶地问：“同志，你是打哪儿来的？”

“我是本地人，就住在城里，早就盼着你们来啦！”

红军战士们把谢廖沙围了起来。

“我的认识他，”那个中国人高兴地笑着说。“他的喊‘同志们万岁！’他的布尔什维克，我们的人，年轻人，好人！”他拍着谢廖沙的肩膀，用半通不通的俄语夸奖他。

谢廖沙的心欢快地蹦跳着。他马上就被红军战士当作自己人了。他刚刚同他们一起，参加了攻打车站的肉搏战。

小城又活跃起来了。受尽苦难的人们都从地下室和地窖里走出来，涌到门口，去看开进城的红军队伍。安东尼娜·瓦西里耶夫娜和瓦莉亚在红军队伍里发现了谢廖沙。他光着头，腰上缠着子弹带，背着步枪，走在战士们的行列里。

安东尼娜·瓦西里耶夫娜气得两手一扬，拍了一下巴掌。

谢廖沙，她的儿子，居然也去打仗啦！这还了得！想想看，他竟在全城人面前背着枪，大模大样地走着，以后会怎么样呢？

安东尼娜·瓦西里耶夫娜想到这里，再也忍不住了，她大声喊起来：“谢廖沙，你给我回家，马上回来！我非给你点厉害看看不可，你这个小混蛋！要打仗，你回家打！”说着，朝儿子跑过去，想把他拦住。

但是，谢廖沙，这个她不止一次扯过耳朵的谢廖沙，却严肃地瞪了她一眼，红着脸，又羞又恼，斩钉截铁地说：“喊什么！我就在这儿，哪儿也不去！”他连停也不停，从母亲身边走了过去。

安东尼娜·瓦西里耶夫娜这下可气坏了：“好哇！你就这样跟你妈说话！往后你就别想再回家！”

“我就是不想回去了！”谢廖沙头也没有回，大声回答说。

安东尼娜·瓦西里耶夫娜惘然若失地站在路上。一队队晒得黝黑、满身灰尘的战士从她身旁走过去。

“大娘，别哭了！我们还要选你儿子当政委呢！”有人大声地开了一句玩笑。

队伍里发出了一阵愉快的笑声。连队前头响起了洪亮而和谐的歌声：

同志们，勇敢向前进，

在斗争中百炼成钢，

为开辟自由的道路，

挺起胸膛走上战场！

整个队伍跟着高声唱了起来。在这雄壮的合唱中，可以听到谢廖沙嘹亮的声音。他找到了新的家，他成了这个家庭里的一名战斗员。

在列辛斯基庄园的大门上，钉上了一块白牌。上面简单地写着：“革委会”。

旁边有一张火红的宣传画。画面上是一个红军战士，两道目光逼视着看画的人，一只手直指看画人的胸膛。下面写着：“你参加红军了吗？”

夜里，师政治部的工作人员把这些无声的“宣传员”贴遍了大街小巷。同时还贴出了革委会第一张告全体劳动人民书：

同志们！

无产阶级的军队已经占领了本市。苏维埃政权已经恢复。

我们号召全体居民保持安定。血腥虐杀犹太居民的匪徒们已经溃逃。为了不让他们卷土重来，为了彻底消灭他们，希望你们踊跃报名参加红军！希望你们全力支持劳动人民的政权！

本市的军权属于卫戍司令员，政权属于革命委员会。

革委会主席多林尼克列辛斯基

庄园里，进进出出的全是新人了。“同志”这个称呼，昨天还要为它付出生命，今天却响遍全城，到处都可以听到。“同志”——这是一个多么激动人心的字眼啊！

多林尼克忘记了睡眠，忘记了休息。

这个木匠正在忙着筹建革命政权。

别墅里一间小屋子的门上贴着一张小纸块，上面用铅笔写着：“党委会”。伊格纳季耶娃同志在这里办公。她是一个沉着镇静的女人。师政治部委派她和多林尼克两个人建立苏维埃政权机构。

只过了一天，工作人员就都坐到办公桌旁边了，打字机嗒嗒地响着，粮食委员会也成立了。粮食委员瓦茨拉夫·特日茨基是一个活泼而性急的人。他以前是糖厂的助理技师。苏维埃政权刚刚建立，他就以罕见的顽强精神投入斗争，向工厂管理部门那些隐蔽起来的、对布尔什维克心怀仇恨的贵族分子发起猛烈进攻。

在全厂大会上，特日茨基用拳头愤怒地敲着讲台的栏杆，用波兰话向他周围的工人们发表了激烈而坚定的演说。他说：“过去的一切，当然别想再回来了。咱们的父兄和咱们自己，一生一世给波托茨基伯爵当牛做马，已经当够了。咱们给他们建造宫殿，可是这位高贵的伯爵大人给了咱们什么呢？

不多不少，刚够咱们饿不死，好给他干活。

“什么波托茨基伯爵呀，桑古什卡公爵呀，那些伯爵、公爵大人骑在咱们脖子上有多少年了？难道波兰人不是跟俄罗斯人、乌克兰人一样，也有很多人给波托茨基当牲口使吗？可是现在那些贵族老爷的走狗却在波兰工人中散布谣言，说什么苏维埃政权要用铁拳来对付波兰人。

“同志们！这是无耻的诽谤。咱们各族工人还从来没有获得过像现在这样的自由。

“所有的无产者都是兄弟，可是对那些贵族老爷，请你们相信，我们一定要狠狠地收拾他们。”

他用手在空中画了一个弧形，又使劲敲了一下讲台的栏杆。

“是谁逼着我们弟兄去流血，去自相残杀呢？是国王，是贵族。许多世纪以来，他们总是派遣波兰农民去打土耳其人，一个民族进攻、屠杀另一个民族的事不断发生。死了多少人！造成了多少

Part One Chapter 8
---

The river gleams dully through the early morning haze; softly its waters gurgle against the smooth pebbles of the banks. In the shallows by the banks the river is calm, its silvery surface almost unruffled; but out in midstream it is dark and restless, hurrying swiftly onward. The majestic Dnieper, the river immortalised by Gogol. The tall right bank drops steeply down to the water, like a mountain halted in its advance by the broad sweep of the waters. The flat left bank below is covered with sandy spots left when the water receded after the spring floods.

Five men lay beside a snub-nosed Maxim gun in a tiny trench dug into the river bank. This was a forward outpost of the Seventh Rifle Division. Nearest the gun and facing the river lay Sergei Bruzzhak. 

The day before, worn out by the endless battles and swept back by a hurricane of Polish artillery fire, they had given up Kiev, withdrawn to the left bank of the river, and dug in there. 

The retreat, the heavy losses and finally the surrender of Kiev to the enemy had been a bitter blow to the men. The Seventh Division had heroically fought its way through enemy encirclement and, advancing through the forests, had emerged on the railway line at Malin Station, and with one furious blow had hurled back the Polish forces and cleared the road to Kiev. 

But the lovely city had been given up and the Red Army men were downcast. 

The Poles, having driven the Red units out of Darnitsa, now occupied a small bridgehead on the left bank of the river beside the railway bridge. But furious counterattacks had frustrated all their efforts to advance beyond that point. 

As he watched the river flowing past, Sergei thought of what had happened the previous day. 

Yesterday, at noon, his unit had given battle to the Poles; yesterday he had had his first hand-tohand engagement with the enemy. A young Polish legionary had come swooping down upon him, his rifle with its long, sabre-like French bayonet thrust forward; he bounded towards Sergei like a hare, shouting something unintelligible. For a fraction of a second Sergei saw his eyes dilated with frenzy. The next instant Sergei's bayonet clashed with the Pole's, and the shining French blade was thrust aside. The Pole fell. . . . 

Sergei's hand did not falter. He knew that he would have to go on killing, he, Sergei, who was capable of such tender love, such steadfast friendship. He was not vicious or cruel by nature, but he knew that he must fight these misguided soldiers whom the world's parasites had whipped up into a frenzy of bestial hatred and sent against his native land. And he, Sergei, would kill in order to hasten the day when men would kill one another no longer. 

Paramonov tapped him on the shoulder. "We'd better be moving on, Sergei, or they'll spot us."

For a year now Pavel Korchagin had travelled up and down his native land, riding on machine-gun carriages and gun caissons or astride a small grey mare with a nick in her ear. He was a grown man now, matured and hardened by suffering and privation. The tender skin chafed to the raw by the heavy cartridge belt had long since healed and a hard callus had formed under the rifle strap on his shoulder. 

Pavel had seen much that was terrible in that year. Together with thousands of other fighting men as ragged and ill-clad as himself but afire with the indomitable determination to fight for the power of their class, he had marched over the length and breadth of his native land and only twice had the storm swept on without him:

the first time when he was wounded in the hip, and the second, when in the bitterly cold February of 1920 he sweltered in the sticky heat of typhus. 

The typhus took a more fearful toll of the regiments and divisions of the Twelfth Army than Polish machine guns. By that time the Twelfth Army was operating over a vast territory stretching across nearly the whole of the Northern Ukraine blocking the advance of the Poles. 

Pavel had barely recovered from his illness when he returned to his unit which was now holding the station of Frontovka, on the Kazatin-Uman branch line. Frontovka stood in the forest and consisted of a small station building with a few wrecked and abandoned cottages around it. Three years of intermittent battles had made civilian life in these parts impossible. Frontovka had changed hands times without number. 

Big events were brewing again. At the time when the Twelfth Army, its ranks fearfully depleted and partly disorganised, was falling back to Kiev under the pressure of the Polish armies, the proletarian republic was mustering its forces to strike a crushing blow at the victory-drunk Polish Whites. 

The battle-seasoned divisions of the First Cavalry Army were being transferred to the Ukraine all the way from the North Caucasus in a campaign unparalleled in military history. The Fourth, Sixth, Eleventh and Fourteenth Cavalry divisions moved up one after another to the Uman area, concentrating in the rear of the front and sweeping away the Makhno bandits on their way to the scene of decisive battles. 

Sixteen and a half thousand sabres, sixteen and a half thousand fighting men scorched by the blazing steppe sun. 

To prevent this decisive blow from being thwarted by the enemy was the primary concern of the Supreme Command of the Red Army and the Command of the Southwestern Front at this juncture. Everything was done to ensure the successful concentration of this huge mounted force. 

Active operations were suspended on the Uman sector. The direct telegraph lines from Moscow to the front headquarters in Kharkov and thence to the headquarters of the Fourteenth and Twelfth armies hummed incessantly. Telegraph operators tapped out coded orders: "Divert attention Poles from concentration cavalry army." The enemy was actively engaged only when the Polish advance threatened to involve the Budyonny cavalry divisions. 

The campfire shot up red tongues of flame. Dark spirals of smoke curled up from the fire, driving off the swarms of restless buzzing midges. The men lay in a semicircle around the fire whose reflection cast a coppery glow on their faces. The water bubbled in messtins set in the bluish-grey ashes. 

A stray tongue of flame leaped out suddenly from beneath a burning log and licked at someone's tousled head. The head was jerked away with a growl: "Damnation!" And a gust of laughter rose from the men grouped around the fire. 

"The lad's so full of book-learning he don't feel the heat of the fire," boomed a middle-aged soldier with a clipped moustache, who had just been examining the barrel of his rifle against the firelight. 

"You might tell the rest of us what you're reading there, Korchagin?" someone suggested. 

The young Red Army man fingered his singed locks and smiled. 

"A real good book, Comrade Androshchuk. Just can't tear myself away from it." 

"What's it about?" inquired a snub-nosed lad sitting next to Korchagin, laboriously repairing the strap of his pouch. He bit off the coarse thread, wound the remainder round the needle and stuck it inside his helmet. "If it's about love I'm your man." 

A loud guffaw greeted this remark. Matveichuk raised his close-cropped head and winked slyly at the snub-nosed lad: "Love's a fine thing, Sereda," he said. "And you're such a handsome lad, a regular picture. Wherever we go the girls fairly wear their shoes out running after you. Too bad a handsome phiz like yours should be spoiled by one little defect: you've got a five-kopek piece instead of a nose. But that's easily remedied. Just hang a Novitsky 10-pounder ( The Novitsky grenade weighing about four kilograms and used to demolish barbed-wire entanglements.) on the end of it overnight and in the morning it'll be all right."

The roar of laughter that followed this sally caused the horses tethered to the machine-gun carriers to whinny in fright.

Sereda glanced nonchalantly over his shoulder. "It's not your face but what you've got in here that counts." He tapped himself on the forehead expressively. "Take you, you've got a tongue like a stinging nettle but you're no better than a donkey, and your ears are cold."

"Now then, lads, what's the sense in getting riled?" Tatarinov, the Section Commander,admonished the two who were about to fly at each other. "Better let Korchagin read to us if he's got something worth listening to."

"That's right. Go to it, Pavlushka!" the men urged from all sides.

Pavel moved a saddle closer to the fire, settled himself on it and opened the small thick volume resting on his knees.

"It's called The Gadfly, Comrades. The Battalion Commissar gave it to me. Wonderful book,Comrades. If you'll sit quietly I'll read it to you."

"Fire away! We're all listening."

When some time later Comrade Puzyrevsky, the Regimental Commander, rode up unnoticed to the campfire with his Commissar he saw eleven pairs of eyes glued to the reader.

He turned to the Commissar:

"There you have half of the regiment's scouts," he said, pointing to the group of men. "Four of them are raw young Komsomols, but they're good soldiers all of them. The one who's reading is Korchagin, and that one there with eyes like a wolfcub is Zharky. They're friends, but they're always competing with each other on the quiet.

Korchagin used to be my best scout. Now he has a very serious rival. What they're doing just now is political work, and very effective it is too. I hear these youngsters are called 'the young guard'. Most appropriate, in my opinion."

"Is that the political instructor reading?" the Commissar asked.

"No. Kramer is the political instructor." Puzyrevsky spurred his horse forward.

"Greetings, Comrades!" he called.

All heads turned toward the commander as he sprang lightly from the saddle and went up to the group.

"Warming yourselves, friends?" he said with a broad smile and his strong face with the narrow,slightly Mongolian eyes lost its severity. The men greeted their commander warmly as they would a good comrade and friend. The Commissar did not dismount.

Pushing aside his pistol in its holster, Puzyrevsky sat down next to Korchagin.

"Shall we have a smoke?" he suggested. "I have some first-rate tobacco here."

He rolled a cigarette, lit it and turned to the Commissar: "You go ahead, Doronin. I'll stay here for a while. If I'm needed at headquarters you can let me know."

"Go on reading, I'll listen too," Puzyrevsky said to Korchagin when Doronin had gone.

Pavel read to the end, laid the book down on his knees and gazed pensively at the fire. For a few moments no one spoke. All brooded on the tragic fate of the Gadfly.

Puzyrevsky puffed on his cigarette, waiting for the discussion to begin.

"A grim story that," said Sereda, breaking the silence. "I suppose there are people like that in the world. It's not many who could stand what he did. But when a man has an idea to fight for he can stand anything," Sereda was-visibly moved. The book had made a deep impression on him.

"If I could lay my hands on that priest who tried to shove a cross down his throat I'd finish the swine off on the spot!" Andryusha Fomichev, a shoemaker's apprentice from Belaya Tserkov, cried wrathfully. 

"A man doesn't mind dying if he has something to die for," Androshchuk, pushing one of the messtins closer to the, fire with a stick, said in a tone of conviction.

"That's what gives a man strength. You can die without regrets if you know you're in the right. That's how heroes are made. 

I knew a lad once, Poraika was his name. When the Whites cornered him in Odessa, he tackled a whole platoon singlehanded and before they could get at him with their bayonets he blew himself and the whole lot of them up with a grenade. And he wasn't anything much to look at. Not the kind of a fellow you read about in books, though he'd be well worth writing about. There's plenty of fine lads to be found among our kind." 

He stirred the contents of the messtin with a spoon, tasted it with pursed-up lips and continued: 

"There are some who die a dog's death, a mean, dishonourable death. I'll tell you something that happened during the fighting at Izyaslav. That's an old town on the Goryn River built back in the time of the princes. There was a Polish church there, built like a fortress. Well, we entered that town and advanced single file along the crooked alleys. A company of Letts were holding our right flank. When we get to the highway what do we see but three saddled horses tied to the fence of one of the houses. Aha, we think, here's where we bag some Poles! About ten of us rushed into the yard. In front of us ran the commander of that Lettish company, waving his Mauser. 

"The front door was open and we ran in. But instead of Poles we found our own men in there. A mounted patrol it was. They'd got in ahead of us. It wasn't a pretty sight we laid eyes on there. 

They were abusing a woman, the wife of the Polish officer who lived there. When the Lett saw what was going on he shouted something in his own language. His men grabbed the three and dragged them outside. There were only two of us Russians, the rest were Letts. Their commander was a man by the name of Bredis. I don't understand their language but I could see he'd given orders to finish those fellows off. They're a tough lot those Letts, unflinching. They dragged those three out to the stables. I could see their goose was cooked. One of them, a great hulking fellow with a mug that just asked for a brick, was kicking and struggling for all he was worth. They couldn't put him up against the wall just because of a wench, he yelped. The others were begging for mercy too. 

"I broke out into a cold sweat. I ran over to Bredis and said: 'Comrade Company Commander,' I said, 'let the tribunal try them. What do you want to dirty your hands with their blood for? The fighting isn't over in the town and here we are wasting time with this here scum.' He turned on me with eyes blazing like a tiger's. Believe me, I was sorry I spoke. He points his gun at me. I've been fighting for seven years but I admit I was properly scared that minute. I see he's ready to shoot first and ask questions afterwards. He yells at me in bad Russian so I could hardly understand what he was saying: 'Our banner is dyed with our blood,' he says. 'These men are a disgrace to the whole army. The penalty for banditry is death.' 

"I couldn't stand it any more and I ran out of that yard into the street as fast as I could and behind me I heard them shooting. I knew those three were done for. By the time we got back to the others the town was already ours. 

"That's what I mean by a dog's death, the way those fellows died. The patrol was one of those that'd joined us at Melitopol. They'd been with Makhno at one time.

Riffraff, that's what they were."

Androshchuk drew his messtin toward him and proceeded to untie his bread bag.

"Yes, you find scum like that on our side too sometimes. You can't account for everyone. On the face of it they're all for the revolution. And through them we all get a bad name. But that was a nasty business, I tell you. I shan't forget it so soon," he wound up, sipping his tea.

Night was well advanced by the time the camp was asleep. Sereda's whistling snores could be heard in the silence. Puzyrevsky slept with his head resting on the saddle.

Kramer, the political instructor, sat scribbling in his notebook.

Returning the next day from a scouting detail, Pavel tethered his horse to a tree and called over Kramer, who had just finished drinking tea.

"Look, Kramer, what would you say if I switched over to the First Cavalry Army? There's going to be big doings there by the looks of it. They're not being massed in such numbers just for fun,are they? And we here won't be seeing much of it."

Kramer looked at him in surprise.

"Switch over? Do you think you can change units in the army the way you change seats in a cinema?"

"But what difference does it make where a man fights?" Pavel interposed. "I'm not deserting to the rear, am I?"

But Kramer was categorically opposed to the idea.

"What about discipline? You're not a bad youngster, Pavel, on the whole, but in some things you're a bit of an anarchist. You think you can do as you please? You forget, my lad, that the Party and the Komsomol are founded on iron discipline. The Party must come first. And each one of us must be where he is most needed and not where he wants to be. Puzyrevsky turned down your application for a transfer, didn't he? Well, there's your answer."

Kramer spoke with such agitation that he was seized with a fit of coughing. This tall, gaunt man was a printer by profession and the lead dust had lodged itself firmly in his lungs and often a hectic flush would appear on his waxen cheeks.

When he had calmed down, Pavel said in a low but firm voice:

"All that is quite correct but I'm going over to the Budyonny army just the same."

The next evening Pavel was missing at the campfire.

In the neighbouring village a group of Budyonny cavalrymen had formed a wide circle on a hill outside the schoolhouse. One giant of a fellow, seated on the back of a machine-gun carrier, his cap pushed to the back of his head, was playing an accordion. The instrument wailed and blared under his inept fingers like a thing in torment, confusing the dashing cavalryman in unbelievably wide red riding breeches who was dancing a mad hopak in the centre of the ring.

Eager-eyed village lads and lasses clambered onto the gun carrier and fences to watch the antics of these troopers whose brigade had just entered their village.

"Go it, Toptalo! Kick up the earth! Ekh, that's the stuff, brother! Come on there, you with the accordion, make it hot!"

But the player's huge fingers that could bend an iron horseshoe with the utmost ease sprawled clumsily over the keys.

"Too bad Makhno got Afanasi Kulyabko," remarked one bronzed cavalryman regretfully. "That lad was a first-class hand at the accordion. He rode on the right flank of our squadron. Too bad he was killed. A good soldier, and the best accordion player we ever had!"

Pavel, who was standing in the circle, overheard this last remark. He pushed his way over to the machine-gun carrier and laid his hand on the accordion bellows. The music subsided.

"What d'you want?" the accordionist demanded with a scowl.

Toptalo stopped short and an angry murmur rose from the crowd: "What's the trouble there?"

Pavel reached out for the instrument. "Let's have a try," he said.

The Budyonny cavalryman looked at the Red infantryman with some mistrust and reluctantly slipped the accordion strap off his shoulder.

With an accustomed gesture Pavel laid the instrument on his knee, spread the sinuous bellows out fanwise and let go with a rollicking melody that poured forth with all the lusty vigour of which the accordion is capable:

Ekh, little apple,

Whither away?

Get copped by the Cheka

And that's where you stay!

Toptalo caught up the familiar tune and swinging his arms like some great bird he swept into thering, executing the most incredible twists and turns, and slapping himself smartly on the thighs,knees, head, forehead, the shoe soles, and finally on the mouth in time with the music.

Faster and faster played the accordion in a mad intoxicating rhythm, and Toptalo, kicking his legs out wildly, spun around the circle like a top until he was quite out of breath.

On June 5, 1920, after a few brief but furious encounters Budyonny's First Cavalry Army broke through the Polish front between the Third and Fourth Polish armies, smashed a cavalry brigade under General Sawicki en route and swept on toward Ruzhiny.

The Polish command hastily formed a striking force and threw it into the breach. Five tanks were rushed from Pogrebishche Station to the scene of the fighting. But the Cavalry Army bypassed Zarudnitsy from where the Poles planned to strike and came out in the Polish rear.

General Kornicki's Cavalry Division was dispatched in pursuit of the First Cavalry Army with orders to strike at the rear of the force, which the Polish command believed to be headed for Kazatin, one of the most important strategic points in the Polish rear. This move, however, did not improve the position of the Poles.

Although they succeeded in closing the breach and cutting off the Cavalry Army, the presence of a strong mounted force behind their lines which threatened to destroy their rear bases and swoop down on their army group at Kiev, was far from reassuring. As they advanced, the Red cavalry divisions destroyed small railway bridges and tore up railway track to hamper the Polish retreat. On learning from prisoners that the Poles had an army headquarters in Zhitomir (actually the headquarters of the whole front was located there), the commander of the First Cavalry Army decided to take Zhitomir and Berdichev, both important railway junctions and administrative centres. At dawn on June 7 the Fourth Cavalry Division was already on its way at full speed to Zhitomir.

Korchagin now rode on the right flank of one of the squadrons in place of Kulyabko, the lamented accordionist. He had been enrolled in the squadron on the collective request of the men, who had refused to part with such an excellent accordion player.

Without checking their foam-flecked horses they fanned out at Zhitomir and bore down on the city with naked steel flashing in the sun.

The earth groaned under the pounding hoofs, the mounts breathed hoarsely, and the men rose in their stirrups.

Underfoot the ground sped past and ahead the large city with its gardens and parks hurried to meet the division. The mounted avalanche flashed by the gardens and poured into the centre of the city,and the air was rent by a fear-inspiring battle-cry as inexorable as death itself.

The Poles were so stunned that they offered little resistance. The local garrison was crushed.

Bending low over the neck of his mount, Pavel Korchagin sped along side by side with Toptalo astride his thin-shanked black. Pavel saw the dashing cavalryman cut down with an unerring blow a Polish legionary before the man had time to raise his rifle to his shoulder.

The iron-shod hoofs grated on the paving stones as they careered down the street. Then at an intersection they found themselves face to face with a machine gun planted in the very middle of the road and three men in blue uniforms and rectangular Polish caps bending over it. There was also a fourth, with coils of gold braid on his collar, who levelled a Mauser at the mounted men.

Neither Toptalo nor Pavel could check their horses and they galloped toward the machine gun,straight into the jaws of death. The officer fired at Korchagin, but missed.

The bullet whanged past Pavel's cheek, and the next moment the Lieutenant had struck his head against the paving stones and was lying limp on his back, thrown off his feet by the horse's onrush.

That very moment the machine gun spat out in savage frenzy, and stung by a dozen bullets,Toptalo and his black crumpled to the ground.

Pavel's mount reared up on its hind legs, snorting with terror, and leapt with its rider over the prone bodies to the men at the machine gun. His sabre described a flashing arc in the air and sank into the blue rectangle of one of the army caps.

Again the sabre flashed upwards ready to descend upon a second head, but the frantic horse leapt aside.

Like a mountain torrent the squadron poured into the streets and scores of sabres flashed in the air.

The long narrow corridors of the prison echoed with cries.

The cells packed with gaunt, hollow-eyed men and women were in a turmoil. They could hear the battle raging in the town—could this mean liberation? Could it be that this force that had swept suddenly into the town had come to set them free?

The shooting reached the prison yard. Men came running down the corridors. And then the cherished, long-awaited words: "You are free, Comrades!"

Pavel ran to a locked door with a tiny window, from which stared dozens of pairs of eyes, and brought his rifle butt down fiercely against the lock again and again.

"Wait, let me crack it with a bomb," cried Mironov. He pushed Pavel aside and produced a hand grenade from a pocket.

Platoon commander Tsygarchenko tore the grenade from his hands.

"Stop, you fool, are you mad! They'll bring the keys in a jiffy. What we can't break down we'll open with keys."

The prison guards were already being led down the corridor, prodded along with revolvers, when the ragged and unwashed prisoners, wild with joy, poured out of their cells.

Throwing a cell door wide open, Pavel ran inside.

"Comrades, you're free! We're Budyonny's men—our division's taken the town!"

A woman ran weeping to Pavel and throwing her arms around him broke into sobs.

The liberation of five thousand and seventy-one Bolsheviks and of two thousand Red Army political workers, whom the Polish Whites had driven into these stone dungeons to await shooting or the gallows, was more important to the division's fighting men than all the trophies they had captured, a greater reward than victory itself. For seven thousand revolutionaries the impenetrable gloom of night had been supplanted by the bright sun of a hot June day.

One of the prisoners, with skin as yellow as a lemon, rushed at Pavel in a transport of joy. It was Samuel Lekher, one of the compositors from the Shepetovka printshop.

Pavel's face turned grey as he listened to Samuel's account of the bloody tragedy enacted in his native town and the words seared his heart like drops of molten metal.

"They took us at night, all of us at once. Some scoundrel had betrayed us to the military gendarmes. And once they had us in their clutches they showed no mercy. They beat us terribly,Pavel. I suffered less than the others because after the first blows I lost consciousness. But the others were stronger than me.

"We had nothing to hide. The gendarmes knew everything better than we did. They knew every step we had taken, and no wonder, for there had been a traitor among us. I can't talk about those days, Pavel. You know many of those who were taken. Valya Bruzzhak, and Rosa Gritsman, a fine girl just turned seventeen—such trusting eyes she had, Pavel! Then there was Sasha Bunshaft,you know him, one of our typesetters, a merry lad, always drawing caricatures of the boss. They took him and two Gymnasium students, Novoselsky and Tuzhits—you remember them too most likely. The others too were local people or from the district centre. Altogether twenty-nine were arrested, six of them women. They were all brutally tortured. Valya and Rosa were raped the first day. Those swine outraged the poor things in every possible way, then dragged them back to the cell more dead than alive. Soon after that Rosa began to rave and a few days later she was completely out of her mind.

"They didn't believe that she was insane, they said she was shamming and beat her unmercifully every time they questioned her. She was a terrible sight when they finally shot her. Her face was black with bruises, her eyes were wild, she looked like an old woman.

"Valya Bruzzhak was splendid to the very end. They all died like real fighters. I don't know how they had the strength to endure it all. Ah, Pavel, how can I describe their death to you? It was too horrible.

"Valya had been doing the most dangerous kind of work: she was the one who had contact with the wireless operators at the Polish headquarters and with our people in the district centre, besides which they found two grenades and a pistol when they searched her place. The grenades had been given to her by the provocateur. Everything had been framed so as to charge them with intending to blow up the headquarters. 

"Ah, Pavel, it is painful for me to speak of those last days, but since you insist I shall tell you. The military court sentenced Valya and two others to be hanged, the rest to be shot. The Polish soldiers who had worked with us were tried two days earlier. Corporal Snegurko, a young wireless operator who had worked in Lodz as an electrician before the war, was charged with treason and with conducting Communist propaganda among the soldiers and sentenced to be shot. He did not appeal, and was shot twenty-four hours after the sentence. 

"Valya was called in to give evidence at his trial. She told us afterwards that Snegurko pleaded guilty to the charge of conducting Communist propaganda but vigorously denied that he had betrayed his country. 'My fatherland,' he said, 'is the Polish Soviet Socialist Republic. Yes, I am a member of the Communist Party of Poland. I was drafted into the army against my will, and once there I did my best to open the eyes of other men like myself who had been driven off to the front. 

You may hang me for that, but not for being a traitor to my fatherland, for that I never was and never will be. Your fatherland is not my fatherland. Yours is the fatherland of the gentry, mine is the workers' and peasants' fatherland. And in my fatherland, which will come—of that I am deeply convinced—no one will ever call me a traitor.' 

"After the trial we were all kept together. Just before the execution we were transferred to the jail. 

During the night they set up the gallows opposite the prison beside the hospital. For the shooting they chose a place near a big ditch over by the forest not far from the road. A common grave was dug for us. 

"The sentence was posted up all over town so that everyone should know of it. The Poles decided to hold a public execution to frighten the population. From early morning they began driving the townsfolk to the place of execution. Some went out of curiosity, terrible though it was. Before long they had a big crowd collected outside the prison wall. From our cell we could hear the hum of voices. They had stationed machine guns on the street behind the crowd, and brought up mounted and foot gendarmes from all parts of the area. A whole battalion of them surrounded the streets and vegetable fields beyond. A pit had been dug beside the gallows for those who were to be hanged. 

"We waited silently for the end, now and then exchanging a few words. We had talked everything over the night before and said our good-byes. Only Rosa kept whispering to herself over in one corner of the cell. Valya, after all the beatings and outrages she had endured, was too weak to move and lay still most of the time. Two local Communist girls, sisters they were, could not keep back the tears as they clung to one another in their last farewell. Stepanov, a young man from the country, a strapping lad who had knocked out two gendarmes when they came to arrest him, told them to stop. 'No tears, Comrades! You may weep here, but not out there. We don't want to give those bloody swine a chance to gloat. There won't be any mercy anyway. We've got to die, so we might as well die decently. We won't crawl on our knees.

Remember, Comrades, we must meet death bravely.' 

"Then they came for us. In the lead was Szwarkowski, the Intelligence Chief, a mad dog of a sadist if there ever was one. When he didn't do the raping himself he enjoyed watching his gendarmes do it. We were marched to the gallows across the road between two rows of gendarmes, 'canaries' we called them on account of their yellow shoulder-knots. They stood there with their sabres bared. 

"They hurried us through the prison yard with their rifle butts and made us form fours. Then they opened the gates and led us out into the street and stood us up facing the gallows so that we should see our comrades die as we waited for our turn to come. It was a tall gallows made of thick logs. 

Three nooses of heavy rope hung down from the crosspiece and under each noose was a platform with steps supported by a block of wood that could be kicked aside. A faint murmur rose from the sea of people which rocked and swayed. All eyes were fixed on us. We recognised some of our people in the crowd. 

"On a porch some distance away stood a group of Polish gentry and officers with binoculars. They had come to see the Bolsheviks hanged. 

"The snow was soft underfoot. The forest was white with it, and it lay thick on the trees like cotton fluff. The whirling snowflakes fell slowly, melting on our burning faces, and the steps of the gallows were carpeted with snow. We were scantily dressed but none of us felt the cold. Stepanov did not even notice that he was walking in his stockinged feet. 

"Beside the gallows stood the military prosecutor and senior officers. At last Valya and the two other comrades who were to be hanged were led out of the jail. They walked all three arm-in-arm, Valya was in the middle supported by the other two for she had no strength to walk alone. But she did her best to hold herself erect, remembering Stepanov's words: 'We must meet death bravely, Comrades!' She wore a woollen jacket but no coat. 

"Szwarkowski evidently didn't like the idea of them walking arm-in-arm for he pushed them from behind. Valya said something and one of the mounted gendarmes slashed her full force across the face with his whip. A woman in the crowd let out a frightful shriek and began struggling madly in an effort to break through the cordon and reach the prisoners, but she was seized and dragged away. It must have been Valya's mother. When they were close to the gallows Valya began to sing. Never have I heard a voice like that—only a person going to his death could sing with such feeling. She sang the Warszawianka, and the other two joined in. The mounted guards lashed out in a blind fury with their whips, but the three did not seem to feel the blows. They were knocked down and dragged to the gallows like sacks. The sentence was quickly read and the nooses were slipped over their heads. At that point we began to sing: 

Arise, ye prisoners of starvation. . . . 

"Guards rushed at us from all sides and I just had time to see the blocks knocked out from under the platforms with rifle butts and the three bodies jerking in the nooses. .. . 

"The rest of us had already been put to the wall when it was announced that ten of us had had our sentences commuted to 20 years' imprisonment. The other sixteen were shot." 

Samuel clutched convulsively at the collar of his shirt as if he were choking. 

"For three days the bodies hung there in the nooses. The gallows were guarded day and night. 

After that a new batch of prisoners was brought to jail and they told us that on the fourth day the rope that held the corpse of Comrade Toboldin, the heaviest of the three, had given way. After that they removed the other two and buried them all. 

"But the gallows was not taken down. It was still standing when we were brought to this place. It stood there with the nooses waiting for fresh victims." 

Samuel fell silent staring with unseeing eyes before him, but Pavel was unaware that the story had ended. The three bodies with the heads twisted horribly to one side swayed silently before his eyes.

The bugle sounding the assembly outside brought Pavel to himself with a start.

"Let's go, Samuel," he said in a barely audible voice.

A column of Polish prisoners was being marched down the street lined with cavalry. At the prison gates stood the Regimental Commissar writing an order on his notepad.

"Comrade Antipov," he said, handing the slip of paper to a stalwart squadron commander, "take this, and have all the prisoners taken under cavalry escort to Novograd-Volynsky. See that the wounded are given medical attention. Then put them on carts, drive them about twenty versts from the town and let them go. We have no time to bother with them. But there must be no maltreatment of prisoners."

Mounting his horse, Pavel turned to Samuel. "Hear that?" he said. "They hang our people, but we have to escort them back to their own side and treat them nicely besides. How can we do it?"

The Regimental Commissar turned and looked sternly at the speaker. "Cruelty to unarmed prisoners," Pavel heard him say as if speaking to himself, "will be punished by death. We are not Whites!"

As he rode off, Pavel recalled the final words of the order of the Revolutionary Military Council which had been read out to the regiment:

"The land of the workers and peasants loves its Red Army. It is proud of it. And on that Army's banners there shall not be a single stain."

"Not a single stain," Pavel whispered.

At the time the Fourth Cavalry Division took Zhitomir, the 20th Brigade of the Seventh Rifle Division forming part of a shock corps under Comrade Golikov was crossing the Dnieper River in the area of Okuninovo village.

Another corps, which consisted of the 25th Rifle Division and a Bashkir Cavalry brigade, had orders to cross the Dnieper and straddle the Kiev-Korosten railway at Irsha Station. This manoeuvre would cut off the Poles' last avenue of retreat from Kiev.

It was during the crossing of the river that Misha Levchukov of the Shepetovka Komsomol organisation perished. They were running over the shaky pontoon bridge when a shell fired from somewhere beyond the steep bank opposite whined viciously overhead and plunged into the water,ripping it to shreds. The same instant Misha disappeared under one of the pontoons. The river swallowed him up and did not give him back. Yakimenko, a fair-haired soldier in a battered cap, cried out: "Mishka! Hell, that was Mishka! Went down like a stone, poor lad!" For a moment he stared horrified into the dark water, but the men running up from behind pushed him on: "What're you gaping there for, you fool. Get on with you!" There was no time to stop for anyone. The brigade had fallen behind the others who had already occupied the right bank of the river.

It was not until four days later that Sergei learned of Misha's death. By that time the brigade had captured Bucha Station, and turning in the direction of Kiev, was repulsing furious attacks by the Poles who were attempting to break through to Korosten.

Yakimenko threw himself down beside Sergei in the firing line. He had been firing steadily for some time and now he had difficulty forcing back the bolt of his overheated rifle. Keeping his head carefully lowered he turned to Sergei and said: "Got to give her a rest. She's red hot!"

Sergei barely heard him above the din of the shooting.

When the noise subsided somewhat, Yakimenko remarked as if casually: "Your comrade got drowned in the Dnieper. He was gone before I could do anything." That was all he said. He tried the bolt of his rifle, took out another clip and applied himself to the task of reloading.

The Eleventh Division sent to take Berdichev encountered fierce resistance from the Poles. A bloody battle was fought in the streets of the town. The Red Cavalry advanced through a squall of machine-gun fire. The town was captured and the remnants of the routed Polish forces fled. Trains were seized intact in the railway yards.

But the most terrible disaster for the Poles was the exploding of an ammunition dump which served the whole front. A million shells went up in the air. The explosion shattered window panes into tiny fragments and caused the houses to tremble as if they were made of cardboard.

The capture of Zhitomir and Berdichev took the Poles in the rear and they came pouring out of Kiev in two streams, fighting desperately to make their way out of the steel ring encircling them.

Swept along by the maelstrom of battle, Pavel lost all sense of self these days. His individuality merged with the mass and for him, as for every fighting man, the word "I" was forgotten; only the word "we" remained: our regiment, our squadron, our brigade.

Events developed with the speed of a hurricane. Each day brought something new.

Budyonny's Cavalry Army swept forward like an avalanche, striking blow after blow until the entire Polish rear was smashed to pieces. Drunk with the excitement of their victories, the mounted divisions hurled themselves with passionate fury at Novograd-Volynsky, the heart of the Polish rear. As the ocean wave dashes itself against the

rockbound shore, recedes and rushes on again, so they fell back only to press on again and again with awesome shouts of "Forward!Forward!"

Nothing could save the Poles—neither the barbed-wire entanglements, nor the desperate resistance put up by the garrison entrenched in the city. And on the morning of June 27 Budyonny's cavalry forded the Sluch River without dismounting, entered Novograd-Volynsky and drove the Poles out of the city in the direction of Korets. At the same time the Forty-Fifth Division crossed the Sluch at Novy Miropol, and the Kotovsky Cavalry Brigade swooped down upon the settlement of Lyubar.

The radio station of the First Cavalry Army received an order from the commander-in-chief of the front to concentrate the entire cavalry force for the capture of Rovno.

The irresistible onslaught of the Red divisions sent the Poles scattering in demoralised panic-stricken groups.

It was in these hectic days that Pavel Korchagin had a most unexpected encounter. He had been sent by the Brigade Commander to the station where an armoured train was standing. Pavel took the steep railway embankment at a canter and reined in at the steel-grey head carriage. With the black muzzles of guns protruding from the turrets, the armoured train looked grim and formidable.Several men in oil-stained clothes were at work beside it raising the heavy steel armour plating that protected the wheels.

"Where can I find the commander of the train?" Pavel inquired of a leather-jacketed Red Army man carrying a pail of water.

"Over there," the man replied pointing to the engine.

Pavel rode up to the engine. "I want to see the commander!" he said. A man with a pockmarked face, clad in leather from head to foot, turned. "I'm the commander."

Pavel pulled an envelope from his pocket.

"Here is an order from the Brigade Commander. Sign on the envelope."

The commander rested the envelope on his knee and scribbled his signature on it. Down on the tracks a man with an oil can was working on the middle wheel of the engine.

Pavel could only see his broad back and the pistol-butt sticking out of the pocket of his leather trousers.

The commander handed the envelope back to Pavel who picked up the reins and was about to set off when the man with the oil can straightened up and turned round. The next moment Pavel had leapt off his horse as though swept down by a violent gust of wind.

"Artem!"

The man dropped his oil can and caught the young Red Army man in a bear's embrace.

"Pavka! You rascal! It's you!" he cried unable to believe his eyes.

The commander of the armoured train looked puzzled, and several gunners standing by smiled broadly at the joy of the two brothers in this chance meeting.

It happened on August 19 during a battle in the Lvov area. Pavel had lost his cap in the fighting and had reined in his horse. The squadrons ahead had already cut into the Polish positions. At that moment Demidov came galloping through the bushes on his way down to the river. As he flew past Pavel he shouted:

"The Division Commander's been killed!"

Pavel started. Letunov, his heroic commander, that man of sterling courage, dead! A savage fury seized Pavel.

With the blunt edge of his sabre he urged on his exhausted Gnedko, whose bit dripped with a bloody foam, and tore into the thick of the battle.

"Kill the vermin, kill 'em! Cut down the Polish szlachtal They've killed Letunov!" And blindly he slashed at a figure in a green uniform. Enraged at the death of their Division Commander, the cavalrymen wiped out a whole platoon of Polish legionaries.

They galloped headlong over the battlefield in pursuit of the enemy, but now a Polish battery went into action. Shrapnel rent the air spattering death on all sides.

Suddenly there was a blinding green flash before Pavel's eyes, thunder smote his ears and red-hot iron seared into his skull. The earth spun strangely and horribly about him and began to turn slowly upside down.

Pavel was thrown from the saddle like a straw. He flew right over Gnedko's head and fell heavily to the ground.

Instantly black night descended.

在黎明前的薄雾里，第聂伯河模糊地闪着光；河水冲刷着岸边的石子，发出轻微的哗哗声。两岸附近的河水是宁静的，平滑的水面泛出一片银灰色，好像凝滞不动似的。河中央，却翻滚着黑沉沉的水流，肉眼就可以看出，它正向下游奔腾而去。这是一条美丽的、庄严的河。正是为了赞美它，果戈理写下了千古绝唱的抒情散文“第聂伯河是神奇美妙的……”河的右岸，峭壁耸立，俯视着水面，宛如一座行进中的高山，骤然在宽阔的河水面前停住了。左岸的下方，全是光秃秃的沙地，这是第聂伯河在春汛退走时淤积起来的。

在河边的一条狭小的战壕里，隐蔽着五个战士。他们按照分工趴在一挺秃鼻子马克沁机枪旁边。这是第七步兵师的前沿潜伏哨。谢廖沙脸朝第聂伯河，侧身卧在机枪紧跟前。

红军部队由于频繁的战斗，已经十分疲乏，接着又遭到波兰军队疯狂的炮击，昨天放弃了基辅，转移到第聂伯河左岸，构筑工事固守。

但是，这次的撤退、重大的伤亡以及最后弃守基辅，严重地影响了战士们的情绪。第七师曾经英勇地突破重围，穿过森林，挺进到马林车站一带的铁路线，经过猛打猛冲，赶走了据守车站的波兰部队，把他们赶进森林，扫清了通向基辅的道路。

现在，这座美丽的城市却失陷了，红军战士个个都怏怏不乐。

波兰白军迫使红军撤出达尔尼察之后，就在左岸靠近铁路桥的地方占领了一个不大的立足点。

但是，不论他们费多大力气，也不能再向前推进一步，他们遇到了红军的猛烈反击。

谢廖沙看着奔流的河水，不禁想起了昨天的情景。

昨天中午，他和大家一起，怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，向波兰白军发起了反冲锋。就在昨天的这场战斗中，他第一次跟一个没有胡子的波兰兵拼刺刀。那个家伙端着步枪，枪上插着像马刀一样长的法国刺刀，一边莫名其妙地喊着什么，一边像兔子那样跳着，向谢廖沙直扑过来。一刹那间，谢廖沙看到了对手那双睁圆了的、杀气腾腾的眼睛，说时迟，那时快，他一摆步枪，用刺刀尖把波兰兵那把明晃晃的法国刺刀拨到了一边。

波兰兵倒下去了……

谢廖沙并没有手软。他知道自己以后还要杀人。就是他，谢廖沙，这个能够那样温柔地爱，能够那样珍惜友谊的人，今后还要杀人。他不是一个狠毒、残忍的人，但是他知道，那些被世界上的寄生阶级欺骗、毒害和驱使的士兵，都是怀着野兽般的仇恨来进攻他亲爱的祖国——苏维埃共和国的。

因此他，谢廖沙，是为了使人类不再互相残杀的日子尽快到来而杀人的。

谢廖沙正想着，帕拉莫诺夫拍了一下他的肩膀，说：“咱们走吧，谢廖沙。敌人很快会发现咱们的。”

保尔·柯察金转战在祖国大地上已经一年了。他乘着机枪车和炮车飞奔，骑着那匹缺了一只耳朵的灰马驰骋。他已经长大成人，比以前更加强壮了。他在艰难困苦的环境中锻炼成长。

他的皮肤曾被沉甸甸的子弹带磨得鲜血直流，现在已经长出了新皮；可是步枪皮带磨出来的硬茧却蜕不掉了。

这一年里，保尔经历了许多可怕的事情。他同成千上万个战士一样，虽然衣不蔽体，胸中却燃烧着永不熄灭的烈火。

为了保卫本阶级的政权，他们南征北战，走遍了祖国大地。保尔只有两次不得不暂时离开革命的风暴。

第一次是因为大腿受了伤。第二次是在严寒的一九二○年二月，得了伤寒，发高烧，大病了一场。

斑疹伤寒造成第十二集团军各师、团的大量减员，简直比波兰军队的机枪还要厉害。这个集团军战线很长，几乎守卫着乌克兰整个北部广大地区，阻挡着波兰白军的进一步推进。保尔刚刚痊愈，就归队了。

现在，他们那个团正在卡扎京——乌曼支线上，据守着弗龙托夫卡车站附近的阵地。

车站在树林子里。站房不大，旁边是一些被遗弃的、破坏得很厉害的小房。这一带根本没法住下去。两年多来，隔不多长时间，就要打一仗。这个小车站真是什么样的队伍都见识过了。

现在，一场新的大风暴又快要酝酿成熟。虽然第十二集团军损失了大量兵员，一部分部队已经失散，在波兰军队的压迫下，全军正在向基辅方向撤退，但是，正是在这个时候，无产阶级的共和国却在部署一项重大的军事行动，准备给被胜利冲昏头脑的波兰白军毁灭性的一击。

久经战斗考验的骑兵第一集团军各师，从遥远的北高加索向乌克兰调动，这是军事史上空前的大进军。第四、第六、第十一和第十四这四个骑兵师，相继向乌曼地区运动，在离我军前线不远的后方集结；他们在走向决战的进军中，顺便清除了沿途的马赫诺匪帮。

这是一万六千五百把战刀，这是一万六千五百名在酷热的草原上经过风吹日晒的战士！

红军最高统帅部和西南战线指挥部尽最大努力，使这个正在准备中的决定性打击事先不被毕苏斯基分子察觉。共和国和各战线的司令部都小心翼翼地掩蔽着这支庞大的骑兵部队的集结。

乌曼前线停止了一切积极的军事行动。从莫斯科直达哈尔科夫前线司令部的专线不停地发出电报，再从那里传到第十四和第十二集团军司令部。狭长的纸条上打出了用密码写成的各种命令，其基本内容都是：“骑兵第一集团军之集结万勿引起波军注意。”只有在波兰白军的推进可能把布琼尼的骑兵部队卷入战斗的情况下，才采取了一些积极的军事行动。司令部总的部署，反映在下面这道简要的命令中：

第３５８号令（密件第８９号）

革命军事委员会委员拉科夫斯基，革命军事委员会主席托洛茨基，第十二、十四和骑兵各集团军总指挥兼集群司令亚基尔同志：

乌克兰境内波兰军队有两个集群：基辅集群和敖德萨集群。其部分兵力部署在第聂伯河左岸，主要兵力，其中包括科尔尼茨基将军（原外阿穆尔骑兵团团长）的由十个骑兵团组成的突击混成骑兵师和陆续开到的波兹南师的部队，则集结在白采尔科维、沃罗达尔卡、塔拉夏、拉基特诺地区。敖德萨集群的主力在日美林卡—敖德萨铁路和布格河之间我第十四集团军战线附近活动。上述两集群之间，大体在拉沙、捷季耶夫、布拉茨拉夫一线，分散部署着第一波兹南师的部队。

罗马尼亚人继续持观望态度。我西方战线各集团军突破敌方防线后，继续顺利地向莫洛杰奇诺、明斯克方向推进。西南战线各集团军的主要任务是击溃并消灭乌克兰境内的波兰军队。

敌上述集群兵力分散，可资利用，考虑到其主办移向基辅地区，且在政治上具有极重要影响，兹决定以敌基辅集群为主要攻击对象。

命令：

１．第十二集团军的基本任务是占领铁路枢纽站科罗斯坚，主力在基辅以北地段强渡第聂伯河，其近期目标是切断博罗江卡站、捷捷列夫站一带的铁路线，阻止敌军向北撤退。

在战线的其余地段要坚决牵制住敌人，在敌军退却时尾追不舍，伺机一举攻占基辅。战斗于五月二十六日开始。

２．亚基尔同志的集群应于五月二十六日凌晨向白采尔科维、法斯托夫方向全线发动强有力的进攻，其目的是尽量吸引更多的敌基辅集群兵力投入战斗，与左翼的骑兵集团军相互配合。

３．骑兵集团军的基本任务是击溃并消灭敌基辅集群的有生力量，夺取其技术装备。五月二十七日凌晨向卡扎京方向发动强有力的进攻，割断敌基辅集群和敖德萨集群之间的联系。以果断猛烈的战斗扫清沿途遇到的一切敌人，于六月一日前占领卡扎京、别尔季切夫地区，并依靠旧康斯坦丁诺夫卡和舍佩托夫卡方面的屏障，向敌人后方挺进。

４．第十四集团军要保证主力突击部队战斗的胜利，为此应将本集团军主力集结在右翼，发动强大突击，于六月一日前占领温尼察—日美林卡地区。战斗于五月二十六日开始。

５．各部队活动分界线见第３４８号令（密件）。

６．收到命令后望回报。

１９２０年５月２０日于克列缅丘格

篝火的红色火舌抖动着，褐色的烟柱盘旋着升到空中。一群群蠓虫，躲开浓烟，慌慌忙忙地飞来飞去。战士们稍稍离开火堆，围成了一个半圆形。篝火在他们脸上抹上了一层紫铜色。

篝火旁边，有几只军用饭盒埋在淡蓝色的炭灰里。

饭盒里的水正在冒泡。突然，一条火舌从燃烧着的木头下面贼溜溜地蹿了出来，在一个低着头的人的乱头发上舔了一下。那人慌忙把头一闪，不满意地咕哝了一句：“呸，真见鬼！”

周围的人都笑了起来。

一个年纪比较大的红军战士，穿着呢上衣，留着一撮小胡子，刚刚对着火光检查完步枪的枪筒，用他那粗嗓子说：“这个小伙子看书入了迷，火烧头发都不知道。”

“喂，柯察金，把你读的东西也给我们讲讲吧！”

那个青年战士摸了摸那绺烧焦了的头发，微笑着说：“啊，安德罗休克同志，这可真是本好书，一拿起来就怎么也放不下。”

保尔身旁坐着一个翘鼻子的青年战士，他正在专心地修理弹药盒上的皮带，想用牙把一根粗线咬断。听保尔这样说，他好奇地问：“书里写的是什么人哪？”他把针插在军帽上，又把多下来的线缠在针上，然后补充了一句：“要是讲的是恋爱故事，我倒挺想听听。”

周围又响起了一阵哄笑。马特韦丘克抬起他那剪了平头的脑袋，狡黠地眯起一只眼睛，做了个鬼脸，对他说：“是啊，谢列达，谈情说爱，可真是件好事。你又挺漂亮，简直是画上的美男子！你走到哪儿，哪儿的姑娘就成天围着你转。你只有一个地方美中不足，就是鼻子太翘了，活像猪拱嘴。不过，还有办法补救：鼻尖上挂个十磅重的诺维茨基手榴弹［诺维茨基手榴弹，重约四公斤，用来爆破铁丝网。——原注］，保险只消一宿，鼻子就翘不起来了。”

又爆发了一阵笑声，吓得拴在机枪车上的马匹打了一个响鼻。

谢列达慢腾腾地转过身来。

“长得漂亮不漂亮倒没什么，脑袋瓜好使才行。”他富有表情地拍了一下自己的前额。“就说你吧，别看舌头上长着刺，挺能挖苦人，只不过是个地地道道的蠢货。你这个木头人连耳朵都是凉的！”

两个人你来我往，眼看就要翻脸，班长塔塔里诺夫赶忙把他们劝开。

“得了，得了，同志们！吵什么呀？还是让保尔挑几段精彩的给大伙念念吧。”

“念吧，保夫鲁沙，念吧！”周围都喊起来。

保尔把马鞍搬到火堆跟前，坐在上面，然后打开那本厚厚的小书，放在膝盖上。

“同志们，这本书叫《牛虻》［英国女作家伏尼契（１８６４—１９６０）描写十九世纪意大利民族民主革命斗争的长篇小说，牛虻是小说的主人公。——译者］。我是从营政委那儿借来的。我读了很受感动。要是大伙好好坐着听，我就念。”

“快念吧！没说的！谁也不会跟你打岔。”

当团长普济列夫斯基同志同政委一道骑马悄悄走近篝火时，他看见十一对眼睛正一动不动地盯着那个念书的人。

普济列夫斯基回过头来，指着这群战士，对政委说：“团里的侦察兵有一半在这儿，里面有四个共青团员，年纪还很轻，个个都是好战士。你看那个念书的，叫柯察金。那边还有一个，看见没有？眼睛像小狼一样，他叫扎尔基。他俩是好朋友，不过暗地里却在较劲。以前柯察金是团里最好的侦察兵，现在他可碰上了厉害的对手。你看，他们现在正在做政治思想工作，不露声色，影响却很大。有人送给他们一个称号，叫‘青年近卫军’，非常合适。”

“念书的那个是侦察队的政治指导员吗？”政委问。

“不是，指导员是克拉梅尔。”

普济列夫斯基催着马向火堆走去。

“同志们，你们好！”他大声喊道。

战士们一齐转过头来。团长轻捷地跳下马，走到坐着的战士们跟前。

“在烤火吗，朋友们？”他笑着问。他的两只小眼睛有点像蒙古人。现在他满面笑容，刚毅的面孔也不像平时那样严峻了。

战士们像对待自己的知心朋友和好同志一样，热烈地欢迎团长。政委没有下马，他还要到别的地方去。

普济列夫斯基把带套的毛瑟枪推到背后，在保尔的马鞍旁边坐了下来，对大家说：“一起抽口烟，怎么样？我这儿有点好烟叶。”

他卷了一支烟抽起来，转脸对政委说：“你走吧，多罗宁，我就留在这儿了。司令部有什么事找我，通知我一声。”

多罗宁走了。普济列夫斯基对保尔说：“接着念吧，我也听听。”

保尔念完了最后几页，把书放在膝盖上，望着篝火，沉思起来。

有好几分钟，谁都没有说话，牛虻的死使所有的人都受到了震动。

普济列夫斯基默默地抽着烟，等着听战士们谈感想。

“这个故事真悲壮。”谢列达打破了沉默。“这就是说，世界上真有这样的人。本来这是一个人没法忍受的，但是，当他是为理想而奋斗的时候，他就什么都忍受得住。”

他说这些话的时候，显然很激动。这本书给他的印象太强烈了。

原先在白采尔科维给鞋匠打下手的安德留沙·福米乔夫激愤地喊道：“那个神甫硬把十字架往牛虻嘴边送，真该死，要是叫我碰上，马上送他上西天！”

安德罗休克用小棍子把饭盒朝火里推了推，坚定不移地说：“知道为什么而死，问题就不同了。到了那个时候，人就会有力量。要是你觉得真理在你一边，你就应当死得从容。英雄行为正是这样产生的。我认识一个小伙子，叫波莱卡。白匪在敖德萨把他包围了，他一冒火，向一个排的匪军冲了过去。没等敌人的刺刀够着他，他就拉响了手榴弹。手榴弹就在他脚下爆炸了。他自己当然是连整尸首都没留下，周围的白匪也给炸倒了一大片。从外表上看，这个人普普通通，也没有什么人给他写书。可是他的事迹真值得写！在咱们同志中间，这样了不起的人物有的是！”

他用匙子在饭盒里搅动了几下，舀出一点茶水，用嘴尝了尝，又接着说：“可也有人死得像只癞皮狗。死得不三不四，很不光彩。

我们在伊贾斯拉夫尔打仗的时候，就发生过这样一桩事。伊贾斯拉夫尔是一座古城，在戈伦河上，基辅大公统治时期就建立了。那儿有座波兰天主教堂，像个堡垒，很难攻。那天我们朝那边冲了过去。大家列成散兵线，顺着小巷朝前摸。我们的右翼是拉脱维亚人。我们跑到大路上，一看，有一家院子的围墙上拴着三匹马，全都备着鞍子。

“好哇，我们想，这回准能抓几个波兰俘虏了。我们十来个人朝那个院子冲过去。他们拉脱维亚人的连长拿着毛瑟枪跑在最前面。

“我们跑到房子跟前，一看门敞开着，就冲了进去。原以为里面一定是波兰兵，哪知道完全不是那么回事。原来是我们自己的三个侦察兵，他们早来了一步，正在干坏事。事实就摆在眼前：他们正在欺负一个妇女。这儿是一个波兰军官的家。他们已经把那个军官的老婆按在地上了。拉脱维亚连长一见这情景，用拉脱维亚话喊了一声。三个家伙全给抓了起来，拖到了院子里。在场的只有两个俄罗斯人，其余的全是拉脱维亚人。连长姓布列季斯。尽管我不懂他们的话，一看也就明白了，他们是要把那三个家伙干掉。这些拉脱维亚人全是铁汉子，性格很刚强。他们把那三个家伙拖到石头马厩跟前。我想，这回完蛋了，准会把他们崩掉！三个人里边，有一个棒小伙子，长相难看极了，拼命挣扎，不让绑，还破口大骂，说不该为了一个娘们就把他枪毙。另外两个家伙都在求饶。

“我一看这情景，浑身都凉了。我跑到布列季斯跟前说：‘连长同志，把他们送军事法庭算了，干吗让他们的血弄脏了你的手呢？城里战斗还没完。哪儿有工夫跟他们算帐。’他转过身来，朝我一瞪眼，我马上就后悔不该多嘴了。他的两只眼睛简直像老虎。毛瑟枪对着我的鼻子。我打了七年仗，这回可真有点害怕了。看来他会不容分说就把我打死。他用俄语向我喊，我勉强才听明白：‘军旗是烈士的鲜血染红的，可是这几个家伙却给全军丢脸。当土匪就得枪毙。’“我吓得赶忙跑到街上去了。背后响起了枪声。我知道，那三个家伙完蛋了。等我们再向前进的时候，城市已经是咱们的了。事情就是这样。那三个人像狗一样死掉了。他们是在梅利托波利附近加入咱们队伍的，早先跟着马赫诺匪帮干过，都是些坏蛋。”

Part One Chapter 9
---

The octopus has a bulging eye the size of a cat's head, a glazed reddish eye green in the centre with a pulsating phosphorescent glow. The octopus is a loathsome mass of tentacles, which writhe and squirm like a tangled knot of snakes, the scaly skin rustling hideously as they move. The octopus stirs. He sees it next to his very eyes. And now the tentacles creep over his body; they are cold and they sting like nettles. The octopus shoots out its sting, and it bites into his head like a leech, and, wriggling convulsively, it sucks at his blood. He feels the blood draining out of his body into the swelling body of the octopus. And the sting goes on sucking and the pain of its sucking is unbearable. 

Somewhere far far away he can hear human voices: 

"How is his pulse now?" 

And another voice, a woman's, replies softly: 

"His pulse is a hundred and thirty-eight. His temperature 103.1. He is delirious all the time." 

The octopus disappears, but the pain lingers. Pavel feels someone touch his wrist. He tries to open his eyes, but his lids are so heavy he has no strength to lift them.

Why is it so hot? Mother must have heated the stove. And again he hears those voices: "His pulse is one hundred and twenty-two now." He tries to open his eyelids. But a fire burns within him. He is suffocating. 

He is terribly thirsty, he must get up at once and get a drink. But why does he not get up? He tries to move but his limbs refuse to obey him, his body is a stranger to him. Mother will bring him some water at once. He will say to her: "I want to drink." Something stirs beside him. Is it the octopus about to crawl over him again? There it comes, he sees its red eyes. . . . From afar comes that soft voice: "Frosya, bring some water!" 

"Whose name is that?" But the effort to remember is too much for him and darkness engulfs him once more. Emerging presently from the gloom he recalls: "I am thirsty." 

And hears voices saying: "He seems to be regaining consciousness." Closer and more distinct now, that gentle voice: "Do you want to drink, Comrade?" 

"Can it be me they are addressing? Am I ill? Oh yes, I've got the typhus, that's it." And for the third time he tries to lift his eyelids. And at last he succeeds. The first thing that reaches his consciousness through the narrowed vision of his slightly opened eyes is a red ball hanging above his head. But the red ball is blotted out by something dark which bends towards him, and his lips feel the hard edge of a glass and moisture, life-giving moisture. The fire within him subsides. 

Satisfied, he whispers: "That's better." 

"Can you see me, Comrade?" 

The dark shape standing over him has spoken, and just before drowsiness overpowers him he manages to say: "I can't see, but I can hear. . . ." 

"Now, who would have believed he would pull through? Yet see how he has clambered back to life! A remarkably strong constitution. You may be proud of yourself, Nina Vladimirovna. You have literally saved his life." And the woman's voice, trembling slightly, answers: "I am so glad!" 

After thirteen days of oblivion, consciousness returned to Pavel Korchagin. His young body had not wanted to die, and slowly he recovered his strength. It was like being born again. Everything seemed new and miraculous. Only his head lay motionless and unbearably heavy in its plaster cast, and he had not the strength to move it.

But feeling returned to the rest of his body and soon he was able to bend his fingers.

Nina Vladimirovna, junior doctor of the military clinical hospital, sat at a small table in her room turning the leaves of a thick lilac-covered notebook filled with brief entries made in a neat slanting handwriting.

August 26, 1920

Some serious cases were brought in today by ambulance train. One of them has a very ugly head wound. We put him in the corner by the window. He is only seventeen. They gave me an envelope with the papers found in his pockets and the case history. His name is Korchagin, Pavel Andreyevich. Among his papers were a well-worn membership card (No. 967) of the Young Communist League of the Ukraine, a torn Red Army identification book and a copy of a regimental order stating that Red Army man Korchagin was coinmended for exemplary fulfilment of a reconnaissance rnission. There was also a note, evidently written by himself, which said: "In the event of my death please write to my relatives: Shepetov-ka, Railway Junction, Mechanic Artem Korchagin." 

He has been unconscious ever since he was hit by a shell fragment on August 19. Tomorrow Anatoli Stepanovich will examine him.

August 27

Today we examined Korchagin's wound. It is very deep, the skull is fractured and the entire right side of the head is paralysed. A blood vessel burst in the right eye which is badly swollen. Anatoli Stepanovich wanted to remove the eye to prevent inflammation, but I dissuaded him, since there is still hope that the swelling might go down. In doing this I was prompted solely by aesthetic considerations. The lad may recover; it would be a pity if he were disfigured. 

He is delirious all the time and terribly restless. One of us is constantly on duty at his bedside. I spend much of my time with him. He is too young to die and I am determined to tear his young life out of Death's clutches. I must succeed. 

Yesterday I spent several hours in his ward after my shift was over. His is the worst case there. I sat listening to his ravings. Sometimes they sound like a story, and I learn quite a lot about his life. 

But at times he curses horribly. He uses frightful language. Somehow it hurts me to hear such awful cursing from him. Anatoli Stepanovich does not believe that he will recover. "I can't understand what the army wants with such children," the old man growls. "It's a disgrace."

August 30

Korchagin is still unconscious. He has been removed to the ward for hopeless cases. The nurse Frosya is almost constantly at his side. It appears she knows him. They worked together once. 

How gentle she is with him! Now I too am beginning to fear that his condition is hopeless.

September 2, 11 p.m.

This has been a wonderful day for me. My patient Korchagin regained consciousness. The crisis is over. I spent the past two days at the hospital without going home.

I cannot describe my joy at the knowledge that one more life has been saved. One death less in our ward. The recovery of a patient is the most wonderful thing about this exhausting work of mine.

They become like children. Their affection is simple and sincere, and I too grow fond of them so that when they leave I often weep. I know it is foolish of me, but I cannot help it.

September 10

Today I wrote Korchagin's first letter to his family. He writes his wound is not serious and he'll soon recover and come home. He has lost a great deal of blood and is as pale as a ghost, and still very weak.

September 14

Korchagin smiled today for the first time. He has a very nice smile. Usually he is grave beyond his years. He is making a remarkably rapid recovery. He and Frosya are great friends. I often see her at his bedside. She must have been talking to him about me, and evidently singing my praises, for now the patient greets me with a faint smile. Yesterday he asked:

"What are those black marks on your arms, doctor?" I did not tell him that those bruises had been made by his fingers clutching my arm convulsively when he was delirious.

September 17

The wound on Korchagin's forehead is healing nicely. We doctors are amazed at the remarkable fortitude with which this young man endures the painful business of dressing his wound.

Usually in such cases the patient groans a great deal and is generally troublesome. But this one lies quietly and when the open wound is daubed with iodine he draws himself taut like a violin string.Often he loses consciousness, but not once have we heard a groan escape him.

We know now that when Korchagin groans he is unconscious. Where does he get that tremendous endurance, I wonder?

September 21

We wheeled Korchagin out onto the big balcony today for the first time. How his face lit up when he saw the garden, how greedily he breathed in the fresh air! His head is swathed in bandages and only one eye is open. And that live, shining eye looked out on the world as if seeing it for the first time.

September 26

Today two young women came to the hospital asking to see Korchagin. I went downstairs to the waiting room to speak to them. One of them was very beautiful. They introduced themselves as Tonya Tumanova and Tatiana Buranovskaya. I had heard of Tonya, Korchagin had mentioned the name when he was delirious. I gave them permission to see him.

October 8

Korchagin now walks unaided in the garden. He keeps asking me when he can leave hospital. I tell him—soon. The two girls come to see him every visiting day. I know now why he never groans. I asked him, and he replied: "Read The Gadfly and you'll know."

October 14

Korchagin has been discharged. He took leave of me very warmly. The bandage has been removed from his eye and now only his head is bound. The eye is blind, but looks quite normal. It was very sad to part with this fine young comrade. But that's how it is: once they've recovered they leave us and rarely do we ever see them again.

As he left he said: "Pity it wasn't the left eye. How will I be able to shoot now?"

He still thinks of the front.

After his discharge from hospital Pavel lived for a time at the Buranovskys where Tonya was staying.

Pavel sought at once to draw Tonya into Komsomol activities. He began by inviting her to attend a meeting of the town's Komsomol. Tonya agreed to go, but when she emerged from her room where she had been dressing for the meeting Pavel bit his lip. She was very smartly attired, with a studied elegance which Pavel felt would be entirely out of place at a Komsomol gathering.

This was the cause of their first quarrel. When he asked her why she had dressed up like that she took offence.

"I don't see why I must look like everyone else. But if my clothes don't suit you, I can stay at home."

At the club Tonya's fine clothes were so conspicuous among all the faded tunics and shabby blouses that Pavel was deeply embarrassed. The young people treated her as an outsider, and Tonya, conscious of their disapproval, assumed a contemptuous, defiant air.

Pankratov, the secretary of the Komsomol organisation at the shipping wharves, a broad-shouldered docker in a coarse linen shirt, called Pavel aside, and indicating Tonya with his eyes,said with a scowl:

"Was it you who brought that doll here?" 

"Yes," Pavel replied curtly. 

"Mm," observed Pankratov. "She doesn't belong here by the looks of her. Too bourgeois by half. 

How did she get in?" 

Pavel's temples pounded. 

"She is a friend of mine. I brought her here. Understand? She isn't hostile to us at all, even if she does think too much about clothes. You can't always judge people by the way they dress. I know as well as you do whom to bring here so you needn't be so officious, Comrade." 

He wanted to say something sharp and insulting but realising that Pankratov was voicing the general opinion he checked himself, and that only increased his anger at Tonya. 

"I told her what to expect! Why the devil must she put on such airs?" 

That evening marked the beginning of the end of their friendship. With bitterness and dismay Pavel watched the break-up of a relationship that had seemed so enduring. 

Several more days passed, and with every meeting, every conversation they drifted further and further apart. Tonya's cheap individualism became unbearable to Pavel. 

Both realised that a break was inevitable. 

Today they had met in the Kupechesky Gardens for the last time. The paths were strewn with decaying leaves. They stood by the balustrade at the top of the cliff and looked down at the grey waters of the Dnieper. From behind the towering hulk of the bridge a tug came crawling wearily down the river with two heavy barges in tow. The setting sun painted the Trukhanov Island with daubs of gold and set the windows of the houses on fire. 

Tonya looked at the golden shafts of sunlight and said with deep sadness: 

"Is our friendship going to fade like that dying sun?" 

Pavel, who had been gazing at her face, knitted his brows sternly and answered in a low voice: 

"Tonya, we have gone over this before. You know, of course, that I loved you, and even now my love might return, but for that you must be with us. I am not the Pavlusha I was before. And I would be a poor husband to you if you expect me to put you before the Party. For I shall always put the Party first, and you and my other loved ones second." 

Tonya stared miserably down at the dark-blue water and her eyes filled with tears. 

Pavel gazed at the profile he had come to know so well, her thick chestnut hair, and a wave of pity for this girl who had once been so dear to him swept over him. 

Gently he laid his hand on her shoulder. 

"Tonya, cut yourself loose and come to us. Let's work together to finish with the bosses. There are many splendid girls among us who are sharing the burden of this bitter struggle, enduring all the hardships and privation. They may not be so well educated as you are, but why, oh why, don't you want to join us? You say Chuzhanin tried to seduce you, but he is a degenerate, not a fighter. You say the comrades were unfriendly toward you. Then why did you have to dress up as if you were going to a bourgeois ball? It's your silly pride that's to blame: why should I wear a dirty old army tunic just because everybody else does? You had the courage to love a workingman, but you cannot love an idea. I am sorry to have to part with you, and I should like to cherish your memory." 

He said no more. 

The next day he saw an order posted up in the street signed by Zhukhrai, chairman of the regional Cheka. His heart leapt. It was with great difficulty that he gained admission to the sailor's office.

The sentries would not let him in and he raised such a fuss that he was very nearly arrested, but in the end he had his way.

Fyodor gave him a very warm welcome. The sailor had lost an arm; it had been torn off by a shell.

The conversation turned at once to work. "You can help me crush the counter-revolution here until you're fit for the front again. Start tomorrow," said Zhukhrai.

The struggle with the Polish Whites came to an end. The Red armies pursued the enemy almost to the very walls of Warsaw, but with their material and physical strength expended and their supply bases left far behind, they were unable to take this final stronghold and so fell back. Thus the "miracle on the Vistula", as the Poles called the withdrawal of the Red forces from Warsaw, came to pass, and the Poland of the gentry received a new lease of life. The dream of the Polish Soviet Socialist Republic was not yet to be fulfilled.

The blood-drenched land demanded a respite.

Pavel was unable to see his people, for Shepetovka was again in Polish hands and had become a temporary frontier outpost. Peace talks were in progress.

Pavel spent days and nights in the Cheka carrying out diverse assignments. He was much upset when he learned that his hometown was occupied by the Poles.

"Does that mean my mother will be on the other side of the border if the armistice is signed now?"

he asked Zhukhrai.

But Fyodor calmed his fears.

"Most likely the frontier will pass through Goryn along the river, which means that your town will be on our side," he said. "In any case we'll know soon enough."

Divisions were being transferred from the Polish front to the South. For while the republic had been straining every effort on the Polish front, Wrangel had taken advantage of the respite to crawl out of his Crimean lair and advance northward along the Dnieper with Yekaterinoslav Gubernia as his immediate objective.

Now that the war with the Poles was over, the republic rushed its armies to the Crimea to wipe out the last hotbed of counter-revolution.

Trainloads of troops, carts, field kitchens and guns passed through Kiev en route to the South. The Cheka of the regional transport services worked at fever pitch these days coping with the bottlenecks caused by the huge flood of traffic. Stations were jammed with trains and frequently traffic would be held up for lack of free tracks.

Telegraph operators tapped out countless messages ordering the line cleared for this or that division. The tickers spilled out endless ribbons of tape covered with dots and dashes and each of them demanding priority: "Precedence above all else . ..

this is a military order . . . clear line immediately. . . ." And nearly every message included a reminder that failure to carry out the order would entail prosecution by a revolutionary military tribunal.

The local transport Cheka was responsible for keeping traffic moving without interruption.

Commanders of army units would burst into its headquarters brandishing revolvers and demanding that their trains be dispatched at once in accordance with telegram number so-and-so signed by the commander of the army. And none of them would accept the explanation that this was impossible. "You'll get that train off if you croak doing it!" And a string of frightful curses 

would follow. In particularly serious cases Zhukhrai would be urgently sent for, and then the excited men who were ready to shoot each other on the spot would calm down at once. At the sight of this man of iron with his quiet icy voice that brooked no argument revolvers were thrust back into their holsters.

At times Pavel would stagger out of his office onto the platform with a stabbing pain in his head. 

Work in the Cheka was having a devastating effect on his nerves. 

One day he caught sight of Sergei Bruzzhak on a truck loaded with ammunition crates. Sergei jumped down, nearly knocking Pavel off his feet, and flung his arms round his friend. "Pavka, you devil! I knew it was you the minute I laid eyes on you." 

The two young men had so much news to exchange that they did not know where to begin. So much had happened to both of them since they had last met. They plied each other with questions, and talked on without waiting for answers. They did not hear the engine whistle and it was only when the train began to move out of the station that they became aware of their surroundings. 

They still had much to say to each other, but the train was already gathering speed and Sergei, shouting something to his friend, raced along the platform and caught on to the open door of one of the box cars. Several hands snatched him up and drew him inside. As Pavel stood watching him go he suddenly remembered that Sergei knew nothing about Valya's death. For he had not visited Shepetovka since he left it, and in the unexpectedness of this encounter Pavel had forgotten to tell him. 

"It's a good thing he does not know, his mind will be at ease," thought Pavel. He did not know that he was never to see his friend again. Nor did Sergei, standing on the roof of the box car, his chest exposed to the autumn wind, know that he was going to his death. 

"Get down from there, Seryozha," urged Doroshenko, a Red Army man wearing a coat with a hole burnt in the back. 

"That's all right," said Sergei laughing. "The wind and I are good friends." 

A week later he was struck by a stray bullet in his first engagement. He staggered forward, his chest rent by a tearing pain, clutched at the air, and pressing his arms tightly against his chest, he swayed and dropped heavily to the ground and his sightless blue eyes stared out over the boundless Ukrainian steppe.

His nerve-wracking work in the Cheka began to tell on Pavel's weakened condition. His violent headaches became more frequent, but it was not until he fainted one day after two sleepless nights that he finally decided to take the matter up with Zhukhrai. 

"Don't you think I ought to try some other sort of work, Fyodor? I would like best of all to work at my own trade at the railway shops. I'm afraid there's something wrong with my head. They told me in the medical commission that I was unfit for army service. But this sort of work is worse than the front. The two days we spent rounding up Sutyr's band have knocked me out completely. 

I must have a rest from all this shooting. You see, Fyodor, I shan't be much good to you if I can barely stand on my feet." 

Zhukhrai studied Pavel's face with concern.

"Yes, you don't look so good. It's all my fault. I ought to have let you go long before this. But I've been too busy to notice." 

Shortly after the above conversation Pavel presented himself at the Regional Committee of the Komsomol with a paper certifying that he was being placed at the Committee's disposal. An officious youngster with his cap perched jauntily over his nose ran his eyes rapidly over the paper and winked to Pavel: 

"From the Cheka, eh? A jolly organisation that. We'll find work for you here in a jiffy. We need everybody we can get. Where would you like to go? Commissary

department? No? All right. 

What about the agitation section down at the waterfront? No? Too bad. Nice soft job that, special rations too." 

Pavel interrupted him. 

"I would prefer the railway repair shops," he said. The lad gaped. "Mm. . . . I don't think we need anybody there. But go to Ustinovich. She'll fit you in somewhere." 

After a brief interview with the dark-eyed girl it was decided to assign Pavel as secretary of the Komsomol organisation in the railway shops where he was to work.

Meanwhile the Whites had been fortifying the gates of the Crimea, and now on this narrow neck of land that once had been the frontier between the Crimean Tatars and the Zaporozhye Cossack settlements stood the modernised fortified line of Perekop. 

And behind Perekop in the Crimea, the old, doomed world which had been driven here from all corners of the land, feeling quite secure, lived in wine-fuddled revelry. 

One chill dank autumn night tens of thousands of sons of the toiling people plunged into the icy waters of the Sivash to cross the bay under the cover of darkness and strike from behind at the enemy entrenched in their forts. Among the thousands waded Ivan Zharky, carrying his machine gun on his head to prevent it from getting wet. 

And when dawn found Perekop seething in a wild turmoil, its fortifications attacked in a frontal assault, the first columns of men that had crossed the Sivash climbed ashore on Litovsky Peninsula to take the Whites from the rear. And among the first to clamber onto that rock coast was Ivan Zharky. 

A battle of unprecedented ferocity ensued. The White cavalry bore down savagely on the Red Army men as they emerged from the water. Zharky's machine gun spewed death, never ceasing its lethal tattoo. Men and horses fell in heaps under the leaden spray. Zharky fed new magazines into the gun with feverish speed. 

Perekop thundered back through the throats of hundreds of guns. The very earth seemed to have dropped into a bottomless abyss, and death carried by thousands of shells pierced the heavens with ear-splitting screams and exploded, scattering myriads of minute fragments far and wide. The torn and lacerated earth spouted up in black clouds that blotted out the sun. The monster's head was crushed, and into the Crimea swept the Red flood of the First Cavalry Army to deliver the final, smashing blow.

Frantic with terror, the White-guards rushed in a panic to board the ships leaving the ports. 

And the Republic pinned the golden badge of the Order of the Red Banner to many a faded Red Army tunic, and one of these tunics was Ivan Zharky's, the Komsomol machine gunner.

Peace was signed with the Poles and, as Zhukhrai had predicted, Shepetovka remained in Soviet Ukraine. A river thirty-five kilometres outside the town now marked the frontier. 

One memorable morning in December 1920 Pavel arrived in his native town. He stepped onto the snowy platform, glanced up at the sign Shepetovka I, then turned left, and went straight to the railway yards and asked for Artem. But his brother was not there. Drawing his army coat tighter about him, Pavel strode off through the woods to the town. 

Maria Yakovlevna turned when the knock came at the door and said, "Come in." A snow-covered figure pushed into the house and she saw the dear face of her son. Her hand flew to her heart, joy robbed her of speech. 

She fell on her son's breast and smothered his face with kisses, and tears of happiness streamed down her cheeks. And Pavel, pressing the spare little body close, gazed silently down at the careworn face of his mother furrowed with deep lines of pain and anxiety, and waited for her to grow calmer. 

Once again the light of happiness shone in the eyes of this woman who had suffered so much. It seemed she would never have her fill of gazing at this son whom she had lost all hope of ever seeing again. Her joy knew no bounds when three days later Artem too burst into the tiny room late at night with his kit-bag over his shoulders. 

Now the Korchagin family was reunited. Both brothers had escaped death, and after harrowing ordeals and trials they had met again. 

"What are you going to do now?" the mother asked her sons. 

"It's back to the repair shops for me, Mother!" replied Artem gaily. 

As for Pavel, after two weeks at home he went back to Kiev where his work was awaiting him.

章鱼的一只眼睛，鼓鼓的，有猫头大小，周围是暗红色，中间发绿，这只眼睛在闪闪发亮。章鱼的几十条长长的腕足，像一团小蛇似的，蜿蜒地蠕动着，上面的鳞发出讨厌的沙沙声。章鱼在游动。他看见章鱼差不多就贴着自己的眼睛。那些腕足在他身上爬着，它们是冰凉的，像荨麻一样刺人。章鱼伸出的刺针如同水蛭，死叮在他的头上，一下一下地收缩，吮吸着他的血液。他感到他的血液正从自己身上流到已经膨胀起来的章鱼体内去。刺针就这样吸个不停。他头上被叮的地方，疼得难以忍受。

从很远很远的一个地方，传来了说话的声音：“现在他的脉搏怎么样？”

有个女人声音更轻地回答：“脉搏一百三十八，体温三十九度五。一直昏迷，说胡话。”

章鱼消失了，但是被它叮过的地方还很疼。保尔觉得有人把手指按在他的手腕上。他想睁开眼睛，但是眼皮很重，怎么也抬不起来。为什么这样热呢？大概是妈把炉子烧得太旺了。又有人在什么地方说话了：“脉搏现在是一百二十二。”

他竭力想抬起眼皮。可是，心里像有一团火，热得喘不上气来。

想喝水，多么想喝水呀！他恨不得马上就爬起来，喝个够。那为什么又起不来呢？他刚想挪动一下身子，但是，立刻觉得身体是别人的，不是自己的，根本不听使唤。妈马上会拿水来的。他要对她说：“我要喝水。”在他旁边，有个什么东西在动。是不是章鱼又来了？就是它，看它那只红色的眼睛……

远处又传来了轻轻的说话声：“弗罗霞，拿点水来！”

“这是谁的名字呢？”保尔竭力在回想，但是一动脑子，便跌进了黑暗的深渊。他从那深渊里浮上来，又想起：“我要喝水。”

他又听到了说话的声音：“他好像有点苏醒了。”

接着，那温和的声音显得更近、更清晰了：“伤员同志，您要喝水吗？”

“我怎么是伤员呢？也许不是跟我说的吧？对了，我不是得了伤寒吗！怪不得叫我伤员呢！”于是，他第三次试着睁开眼睛，这回终于成功了。从睁开的小缝里，他最先看到的是他面前有一个红色的球，但是，这个球又让一个黑糊糊的东西挡住了。这个黑糊糊的东西向他弯下来，于是，他的嘴唇触到了玻璃杯口和甘露般的液体。心头的那团火逐渐熄灭了。

他心满意足地低声说：“现在可真舒服。”

“伤员同志，您看得见我吗？”

这问话就是向他弯下来的那个黑糊糊的东西发出来的。

这时，他又要昏睡了，不过还来得及回答一句：“看不见，但是能听见……”

“谁能想到他还会活过来呢？可是您看，他到底挣扎着活过来了。多么顽强的生命力啊。尼娜·弗拉基米罗夫娜，您真可以骄傲。这完全是因为您护理得好。”

一个女人的声音非常激动地回答：“啊，我太高兴了！”

昏迷了十三天之后，保尔终于恢复了知觉。

他那年轻的身体不肯死去，精力在慢慢恢复。这是他第二次获得生命，什么东西都像是很新鲜，很不平常。只是他的头固定在石膏箱里，沉甸甸的，他也根本没有力量移动一下。不过身体的感觉已经恢复，手指能屈能伸了。

一间四四方方的小屋里，陆军医院的见习医生尼娜·弗拉基米罗夫娜正坐在小桌子后边，翻看她那本厚厚的淡紫色封面的笔记本。里面是她用纤巧的斜体字写的日记：

１９２０年８月２６日

今天从救护列车上给我们送来一批重伤员。一个头部受重伤的红军战士被安置在病室角上靠窗的病床上。他只有十七岁。我收到一个口袋，里面除了病历，还有从他衣袋里找出来的几份证件。他叫保尔·安德列耶维奇·柯察金。

证件有：一个磨破的乌克兰共产主义青年团第九六七一号团证，上面记载的入团时间是一九一九年；一个弄破的红军战士证；还有一张摘抄的团部嘉奖令，上面写的是：对英勇完成侦察任务的红军战士柯察金予以嘉奖。

此外，还有一张看来是他亲笔写的条子：

如果我牺牲了，请同志们通知我的家属：舍佩托夫卡市铁路机车库钳工阿尔焦姆·柯察金。

这个伤员从八月十九日被弹片打伤以后，一直处于昏迷状态。明天阿纳托利·斯捷潘诺维奇要给他做检查。

８月２７日

今天检查了柯察金的伤势。伤口很深，颅骨被打穿，头部右侧麻痹。右眼出血，眼睛肿胀。

阿纳托利·斯捷潘诺维奇打算摘除他的右眼，以免发炎，不过我劝他，只要还有希望消肿，就先不要做这个手术。他同意了。

我的主张完全是从审美观点出发的。如果这个年轻人能活过来，为什么要摘除一只眼睛，让他破相呢？

他一直说胡话，折腾得很厉害，身边必须经常有人护理。

我在他身上花了很多时间。他这样年轻，我很可怜他。只要力所能及，我一定要把他从死神手里夺过来。

昨天下班后，我在病房里又呆了几个小时。他的伤势最重。我注意听他在昏迷中说些什么。有时候他说胡话就像讲故事一样。我从中知道了他生活中的许多事情。不过，有时候他骂人骂得很凶。这些骂人话都是不堪入耳的。我听了之后，不知道为什么感到很难过。阿纳托利·斯捷潘诺维奇说他救不活了。这老头生气地咕哝说：“我真不懂，他差不多还是一个孩子，部队怎么能收他呢？真是岂有此理。”

８月３０日

柯察金仍然没有恢复知觉。现在他躺在那间专门病室里，那里都是一些快要死的病人。护理员弗罗霞寸步不离地守在他身旁。原来她认识他。很久以前，他们在一起做过工。她对这个伤员是多么体贴入微呀！现在连我也觉得，他已经没有什么希望了。

９月２日

现在是夜里十一点。今天简直是我的节日。我负责的伤员柯察金恢复了知觉，他活过来了。危险期已经过去了。这两天我一直没有回家。

又有一个伤员救活了，现在我的愉快心情是难以形容的。

我们病房里又可以少死一个人。在我个人的繁忙工作中，最愉快的事莫过于看到病人恢复了健康。他们总是像小孩子那样依恋着我。

他们对朋友真挚而淳朴，所以当我们分别的时候，有时我甚至掉了眼泪。这未免有些可笑，然而却是事实。

９月１０日

今天我替柯察金写了第一封家信。他说他受了点轻伤，很快就会治好，然后一定回家去看看；实际上他流了很多血，脸色像纸一样苍白，身体还很虚弱。

９月１４日

柯察金第一次微笑了。他笑得很动人。平时他很严肃，这和他的年龄很不相称。他的身体在复原，速度快得惊人。他和弗罗霞是老朋友。我常常看见她坐在他的病床旁边。看来，她把我的情况都讲给他听了，不用说，是过分地夸奖了我，所以我每次进屋，他总是对我微微一笑。昨天他问我：“大夫，您手上怎么紫一块青一块的？”

我没有告诉他，这是他在昏迷中狠命攥住我的手留下的伤痕。

９月１７日

柯察金额上的伤口看样子好多了。换药的时候，他那种非凡的毅力真叫我们这些医生吃惊。

一般人在这种情况下总要不断地呻吟，发脾气，可是他却一声不吭。给他伤口上碘酒的时候，他把身子挺得像根绷紧了的弦。他常常疼得失去知觉，但是从来没有哼过一声。

现在大家都知道：要是柯察金也呻吟起来，那就是说他昏迷了。他这种顽强精神是从哪里来的呢？我真不明白。

９月２１日

今天柯察金坐着轮椅，第一次被推到医院宽敞的阳台上。

在他看着花园、贪婪地呼吸着新鲜空气的时候，他是一副什么样的神情啊！他的脸上缠着绷带，只露出一只眼睛。这只眼睛闪闪发亮，不停地转动着，观察着周围的一切，就像是第一次看到这个世界似的。

９月２６日

今天有人叫我到楼下的接待室去，那里有两个姑娘等着我。其中一个长得很漂亮。她们要看柯察金。她们的名字是冬妮亚·图曼诺娃和塔季亚娜·布拉诺夫斯卡娅。冬妮亚这个名字我知道，因为柯察金说胡话的时候多次提到过她。我允许她们进去看他。

１０月８日

柯察金第一次不用别人搀扶在花园里散步了。他老向我打听，什么时候可以出院。我告诉他快了。每到探病的日子，那两个姑娘就来看他。现在我才明白，他为什么一直没有呻吟，而且从来也不呻吟。我问他原因，他说：“您读一读《牛虻》就明白了。”

１０月１４日

柯察金出院了。我们十分亲切地互相道别。他眼睛上的绷带已经去掉，只是前额还包扎着。那只眼睛是失明了，不过从外表上看不出来。同这么好的同志分手，我感到十分难过。

向来就是这样：病人好了，就离开我们走了，而且希望不再回来见我们。临别的时候，柯察金说：“还不如左眼瞎了呢，现在我怎么打枪呀？”

他仍然一心想着前线。

保尔出院之后，起初就住在冬妮亚寄宿的布拉诺夫斯基家里。

他立刻试着吸引冬妮亚参加社会活动。他邀请冬妮亚参加城里共青团的会议。冬妮亚同意了。但是，当她换完衣服走出房间的时候，保尔却紧咬着下嘴唇。她打扮得那样漂亮，那样别出心裁，保尔都没法带她到自己的伙伴们那里去了。

于是他们之间发生了第一次冲突。保尔问她，为什么要这样打扮，她生气了，说：“我从来就不喜欢跟别人一个样子；要是你不便带我去，我就不去好了。”

那天，在俱乐部里，大家都穿着退色的旧衣服，唯独冬妮亚打扮得花枝招展。保尔看在眼里，觉得很不痛快。同志们都把她看做外人，她也觉察到了，就用轻蔑的、挑衅的目光看着大家。

货运码头的共青团书记潘克拉托夫，一个宽肩膀、穿粗帆布衬衣的装卸工，把保尔叫到一边，不客气地看了看他，又瞟了冬妮亚一眼，问：“那位漂亮小姐是你带来的吗？”

“是我。”保尔生硬地回答。

“哦……”潘克拉托夫拖长声音说。“可是她那副打扮不像是咱们的人，倒像资产阶级小姐。怎么能让她进来？”

保尔的太阳穴怦怦地跳起来。

“她是我的朋友，我才带她来的。懂吗？她并不是咱们的对头，要说穿戴吗，确实是有点问题，不过，总不能单凭穿戴衡量人吧。什么人能带到这儿来，我也懂，用不着你来挑毛病，同志。”

他本来还想顶撞他两句，但是忍住了，因为他知道潘克拉托夫讲的实际上是大家的意见。这样一来，他一肚子气就都转移到冬妮亚身上去了。

“我早就跟她说了！干吗要出这个风头？”

这天晚上他俩的友谊开始出现了裂痕。保尔怀着痛苦和惊讶的心情看到，那一向似乎是很牢固的友谊在逐渐破裂。

又过去了几天。每一次会面，每一次谈话，都使他们的关系更加疏远，更加不愉快。保尔对冬妮亚的那种庸俗的个人主义愈来愈不能容忍了。

他们两个人都很清楚，感情的最后破裂已经是不可避免的了。

这一天，他们来到黄叶满地的库佩切斯基公园，准备作最后一次谈话。他们站在陡岸上的栏杆旁边；第聂伯河从下面滚滚流过，闪着灰暗的光；一艘拖轮用轮翼疲倦地拍打着水面，拽着两只大肚子驳船，慢腾腾地从巨大的桥孔里钻出来，逆流而上。落日的余辉给特鲁哈诺夫岛涂上了一层金黄色，房屋的玻璃也被它照得火一样通红。

冬妮亚望着金黄色的余辉，忧伤地说：“难道咱们的友谊真的要像这落日，就这样完了吗？”

保尔目不转睛地看着她；他紧皱着眉头，低声说：“冬妮亚，这件事咱们已经谈过了。不用说你也知道，我原来是爱你的，就是现在，我对你的爱情也还可以恢复，不过，你必须跟我们站在一起。我已经不是从前的那个保夫鲁沙了。那时候我可以为了你的眼睛，从悬崖上跳下去，回想起来，真是惭愧。现在我说什么也不会跳。拿生命冒险是可以的，但不是为了姑娘的眼睛，而应该是为了别的，为了伟大的事业。如果你认为，我首先应该属于你，其次才属于党，那么，我绝不会成为你的好丈夫。因为我首先是属于党的，其次才能属于你和其他亲人。”

冬妮亚悲伤地凝视着蓝色的河水，两眼噙着泪水。

保尔从侧面注视着她那熟悉的脸庞和栗色的浓发。过去，这个姑娘对他来说，曾经是那样可爱可亲，此刻他不禁对她产生了一种怜惜之情。

他小心地把手放在她的肩膀上。

“把扯你后腿的那些东西统统扔掉，站到我们一边来吧。

咱们一道去消灭财主老爷们。我们队伍里有许多优秀的姑娘，她们跟我们一起肩负着残酷斗争的全部重担，跟我们一起忍受着种种艰难困苦。她们的文化水平也许不如你高，但是你到底为什么不愿意跟我们在一起呢？你说，丘扎宁曾经想用暴力污辱你，但是他是红军中的败类，不是一个战士。你又说，我的同志们对你不友好，可是，那天你为什么要那样打扮，像去参加资本家的舞会一样呢？你会说：我不愿意跟他们一样，穿上肮脏的军便服。这是虚荣心害了你。你有勇气爱上一个工人，却不爱工人阶级的理想。跟你分开，我是感到遗憾的，我希望你能给我留下美好的印象。”

他不再说下去了。

第二天，保尔在街上看见一张布告，下面的署名是省肃反委员会主席费奥多尔·朱赫来。他的心跳起来了。他去找这个老水兵，但是卫兵不让他进去。他软磨硬泡，弄得卫兵差点把他抓起来。费了好大劲，最后他总算见到了朱赫来。

他们两个人对这次会面都很高兴。朱赫来的一只胳膊已经给炮弹炸掉了。他们马上就把工作谈妥了。朱赫来说：“你既然不能上前线，就在这儿跟我一起搞肃反工作吧。明天你就来上班。”

同波兰白军的战争结束了。红军几乎已经打到华沙城下，只是因为远离后方基地，得不到人力和物力的补充，没能攻破波军的最后防线，就撤了回来。波兰人把红军的这次撤退叫做“维斯瓦河上的奇迹”。这样一来，地主老爷的白色波兰又存在下来了，建立波兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的理想暂时没有能够实现。

到处是血迹的国家需要休息一下。

保尔没有回家去探望亲人，因为舍佩托夫卡又被波兰白军占领了，目前正是双方战线分界的地方。和平谈判正在进行。保尔日日夜夜都在肃反委员会工作，执行各种任务。他就住在朱赫来的房间里。听说舍佩托夫卡被波兰人占领了，他发起愁来。

“怎么办呢，费奥多尔，要是就这么讲和了，我母亲不就划到外国去了吗？”

朱赫来安慰他说：“边界大概会沿哥伦河划分，舍佩托夫卡还在咱们这一边。咱们很快就会知道的。”

许多师团都从波兰前线调往南方。因为正当苏维埃共和国把全部力量集中在波兰前线的时候，弗兰格尔利用这个机会，从克里木半岛的巢穴里爬了出来，沿第聂伯河北上，逼近叶卡捷琳诺斯拉夫省。

现在同波兰的战争已经结束，国家就把军队调到克里木半岛去捣毁这个反革命的最后巢穴。

满载士兵、车辆、行军灶和大炮的军用列车，经过基辅向南开去。铁路肃反委员会的工作忙得不可开交。许多列车源源不断地开来，经常造成堵塞，各个车站都挤得水泄不通，往往因为腾不出线路而使整个交通中断。收报机不断收到最后通牒式的电报，命令给某某师让路。打满密码的小纸带没完没了地从收报机里爬出来，电文一律都是：“十万火急……”而且，几乎每封电报都警告说，违令者交革命军事法庭，依法制裁。

铁路肃反委员会就是负责处理这种“堵塞”的机构。

各个部队的指挥员都闯进来，挥动着手枪，要求根据司令员的某某号电令，立即发走他们的列车。

如果说这个办不到，他们连听都不愿意听，都说：“你豁出命来，也要先把我的车发走！”接着便是一场可怕的争吵。

遇到特别复杂的情况，就赶紧把朱赫来请来。于是，正吵得不可开交，眼看要开枪动武的双方，马上就平静下来。

朱赫来那钢铁般的身躯，沉着冷静的态度，强硬的不容反驳的语气，总能迫使他们把已经拔出来的手枪插回枪套里去。

保尔经常头疼得像针扎一样，但是还得到站台上去。肃反委员会的工作损害着他的神经。

有一天，保尔突然在一节装满弹药箱的敞车上，看见了谢廖沙·勃鲁扎克。谢廖沙从敞车上跳下来，扑到他身上，差一点把他撞倒。他紧紧抱住保尔，说：“保尔，你这鬼家伙！我一下就认出你来了。”

两个朋友都不知道问对方些什么，自己讲些什么才好。他们分别之后，经历过多少事情啊！他们相互问长问短，还没等对方回答，自己就又讲开了。他们连汽笛声都没有听到，直到车轮开始慢慢转动了，才把互相拥抱着的胳膊松开。

有什么办法呢？刚刚会面，又要分别了。火车在加速。谢廖沙怕误了车，最后向他的朋友喊了一句什么，就沿着站台跑去。一节加温车厢的门敞开着，他一把抓住门把手，马上有几只手拽住他，把他拉进了车厢。保尔站在那里目送着远去的列车，直到这时他才想起来，谢廖沙还不知道瓦莉亚已经牺牲的消息。谢廖沙一直没有回过故乡，而保尔又根本没有想到会同他见面，惊喜之下，竟忘了把这件事告诉他。

“他不知道也好，免得一路上难受。”保尔这样想。他万万没有想到，这竟是他们俩最后的一次会面。谢廖沙这时候正站在车顶上，用胸膛迎着秋风，他也没有想到，死神正在前面等着他。

“坐下吧，谢廖沙。”军大衣背上烧了个窟窿的红军战士多罗申科劝他说。

“没关系，我跟风是好朋友，吹一吹更痛快。”谢廖沙笑着回答。

一星期之后，第一次投入战斗，他就在秋天的乌克兰原野上牺牲了。

从远处飞来一颗流弹，打中了他。他哆嗦了一下，向前迈进一步，胸口火辣辣地疼痛。他没有喊叫，身子轻轻一晃，张开两臂又合抱起来，紧紧地捂住胸口，然后弯下腰，像要跳跃的样子，僵硬的身体一下子就摔倒在地上了。那双蓝色的眼睛一动不动地凝视着一望无际的原野。

肃反委员会的工作十分紧张，保尔本来就没有完全复原，现在健康状况又恶化了。受伤后留下的头疼病经常发作，有一次，他连熬了两个通宵，终于失去了知觉。

过后，他去找朱赫来。

“费奥多尔，我想调动一下工作，你看合适不？我很想到铁路工厂搞我的本行去。我总觉得这儿的工作我干不了。医务委员会跟我说，我不适合在部队工作，可是这儿的工作比前线还紧张。这两天肃清苏特里匪帮，简直把我累垮了。我得暂时摆脱这种动刀动枪的工作。费奥多尔，你知道，我现在连站都站不稳，哪能做好肃反工作呢？”

朱赫来关切地看了看他，说：“是啊，你的气色很难看，早就该解除你的工作了，都怪我照顾得不周到。”

这次谈话之后，保尔带着介绍信到团省委去了。介绍信上说，请团省委另行分配他的工作。

一个故意把鸭舌帽拉到鼻梁上的调皮小伙子，看了看介绍信，开心地向保尔挤了一下眼睛，说：“从肃反委员会来的吗？那可是个好地方。好吧，我们马上就给你找个工作。这儿正缺人呢。把你分配到哪儿去呢？省粮食委员会行吗？不去？那就算了。那么，码头上的宣传站去不去？也不去？哟，那你可就错了。那个地方多好啊，头等口粮。”

保尔打断他的话，说：“我想到铁路上去，给我分铁路工厂去吧。”

那个小伙子惊异地看了看他，说：“到铁路工厂去？这个……那儿可不需要人。这么办吧，你去找乌斯季诺维奇同志，让她给你找个地方吧。”

保尔同那个皮肤黝黑的姑娘乌斯季诺维奇谈了不一会儿，就谈妥了：他到铁路工厂去担任不脱产的共青团书记。

就在这个时候，在克里木的大门旁边，在这个半岛通往大陆的狭小的喉管上，也就是在从前克里木鞑靼人同扎波罗什哥萨克分界的那个地方，白匪军重建了一座碉堡林立、戒备森严的要塞——佩列科普。

注定要灭亡的旧世界的残渣余孽，从全国各地逃到克里木半岛来，他们自以为躲在佩列科普后面绝对安全，便整天沉湎在花天酒地之中。

在一个风雨交加的秋夜，数万名劳动人民的子弟兵，跳进了冰冷的湖水，涉渡锡瓦什湖，从背后去袭击龟缩在坚固工事里的敌人。带领他们的是英名盖世的卡托夫斯基和布柳赫尔同志。数万名战士跟随着两位将领无畏地前进，去砸烂最后一条毒蛇的头，这条蛇身子盘踞在克里木半岛，毒舌却伸到了琼加尔近旁。伊万·扎尔基就是这些子弟兵中的一个，他小心翼翼地把机枪顶在头上，在水中前进。

天刚蒙蒙亮，佩列科普像捅开的蜂窝一样乱成了一团，几千名红军战士，越过层层障碍物，从正面猛冲上去。与此同时，在白匪后方，涉渡锡瓦什湖的红军先头部队，也在利托夫斯基半岛登岸了。扎尔基就是最先爬上石岸的战士中的一个。

空前激烈的血战开始了。白军的骑兵像一群狂暴的野兽，向爬上岸的红军战士猛扑过来。扎尔基的机枪不停地喷射着死亡，成堆的敌人和马匹在密集的弹雨中倒了下去。扎尔基用飞快的速度一个接一个地换着子弹盘。

几百门大炮在佩列科普轰鸣着。大地似乎崩坍了，陷进了无底的深渊。成千颗炮弹发出刺耳的呼啸声，穿梭般地在空中飞来飞去，爆裂成无数碎片，向四周散布着死亡。大地被炸得开了花，泥土翻到半空中，团团黑色的烟尘遮住了太阳。

毒蛇的头终于被砸碎了。红色的怒潮涌进了克里木，骑兵第一集团军的各师冲进了克里木，在这最后一次的攻击中，他们杀得敌军失魂丧胆。惊慌失措的白卫军争先恐后地挤上汽船，向海外逃遁。

苏维埃共和国颁发了金质的红旗勋章。勋章佩戴在战士们褴褛的制服上，佩戴在心脏跳动的地方。机枪手、共青团员伊万·扎尔基也荣获了这种奖赏。

对波兰的和约签订了。正像朱赫来预料的那样，舍佩托夫卡仍然属于苏维埃乌克兰，分界线划在离这座小城三十五公里的一条河上。一九二○年十二月，在一个值得纪念的早晨，保尔乘火车回到了他熟悉的故乡。

他踏上铺着白雪的站台，瞥了一眼“舍佩托夫卡车站”的牌子，立刻拐向左边，朝机车库走去。他去找阿尔焦姆，但是阿尔焦姆不在。于是，他裹紧军大衣，快步穿过树林，朝城里走去。

玛丽亚·雅科夫列夫娜听到敲门声，转过身来，喊了一声“请进！”一个满身雪花的人走了进来。她立刻就认出了自己可爱的儿子。她两手捂住心口，高兴得连话都说不出来了。

她把自己瘦小的身体紧紧地贴在儿子的胸前，不停地吻着儿子的脸，流下了幸福的热泪。

保尔也紧紧地拥抱着母亲，看着她那因为忧愁和期待而消瘦了的、满是皱纹的脸。他一句话也没有说，等着她平静下来。

这位受尽苦难的女人，现在眼睛里又闪起了幸福的光芒。

在儿子回来以后的这些天里，她跟他谈多久也谈不完，看他多久也看不够，她真没有想到还能看到他。又过了两三天，阿尔焦姆半夜里也背着行军袋闯进了这间小屋。这时候，她喜上加喜，那股高兴劲就更没法说了。

柯察金家的小房子里，一家人又团聚了。兄弟俩经历过千辛万苦和严峻的考验，都平安地回来了……

“往后，你们俩打算怎么办呢？”玛丽亚·雅科夫列夫娜问。

“还是干我的钳工去，妈。”阿尔焦姆回答。

保尔呢，他在家里住了两个星期，又回到了基辅，因为那里的工作正在等着他。

共青团铁路区委员会调来一位新书记，他就是伊万·扎尔基。保尔是在书记办公室见到他的。首先映入眼帘的是他的勋章。对这次见面，保尔一开头说不上心头是什么滋味，内心深处多少有些妒忌。扎尔基是红军的英雄。正是他，乌曼战斗一打响，就以英勇善战、出色完成战斗任务而著称，是部队里数一数二的人物。如今扎尔基成了区委书记，恰好是他保尔的顶头上司。

扎尔基把保尔当作老朋友，友好地接待了他。保尔对一闪而过的妒意感到惭愧，也热情地同扎尔基打了招呼。

他们一起工作很顺手，成了大家都知道的知心朋友。在共青团省代表会议上，铁路区委有两个人当选为省委委员——保尔和扎尔基。保尔从工厂领到一小间住房，四个人搬了进来，除保尔外，还有扎尔基、厂团支部宣传鼓动员斯塔罗沃伊和团支部委员兹瓦宁，组成了一个公社。他们整天忙于工作，总要到深夜才回到家中。

党要实行新政策的消息传到了共青团省委，不过，起初只是一些零碎的、不成形的说法。过了几天，在第一次学习研讨政策提纲的会上出现了分歧。保尔不完全理解提纲的精神实质。他离开会场的时候心里沉甸甸的，想不通。他在铸造车间遇到杜达尔科夫，一个矮墩墩的工长，共产党员。杜达尔科夫脸朝亮光向保尔眨了眨白不呲咧的眼睛，叫住了他，说：“这到底是怎么回事？真的要让资本家东山再起？听说还要开商店，大做买卖。这倒好，打呀打呀，打到最后，一切照旧。”

保尔没有答理他，可心头的疑虑却越来越重了。

不知不觉中他站到了党的对立面，而一旦卷入反党活动，他便表现得十分激烈。他在共青团省委全会上的第一次发言激起了争论的巨浪。会场上马上形成了少数派和多数派。接下来是痛苦的日日夜夜。整个党组织、团组织，辩论争吵到了白热化的程度。保尔和他的同伙们的死硬立场在省委内造成了一种令人窒息的气氛。

共青团省委书记阿基姆身板结实，高额头，浑身充满活力，政治上也很成熟，他同丽达·乌斯季诺维奇一起找保尔和观点同他相同的人个别谈心，解决他们的问题，但是毫无结果。保尔开门见山，粗鲁而又直截了当地说：“你回答我，阿基姆，资产阶级又有了生存的权利。我弄不清那些高深的理论。我只知道一点：新经济政策是对我们事业的背叛。我们过去进行斗争，可不是为了这个目的，我们工人不同意这么做，要尽全力来反对这种做法。你们大概甘愿给资产阶级当奴才吧？那就悉听尊便。”

阿基姆火冒三丈。

“保尔，你脑子开开窍，你都说了些什么话？你是在侮辱整个党，诽谤党。你得的是狂热病，还固执己见，不想弄明白简单的道理。要是继续执行战时共产主义政策，我们就是葬送革命，就会给反革命分子以可乘之机，发动农民来反对我们。你不想理解这一点。既然你不打算用布尔什维克的方式来探讨解决问题，反而以斗争相威胁，那我们只好奉陪了。”

两个人分别的时候，已反目成仇。

在全区党员大会上，从中央跑来的工人反对派代表发表演说，遭到了多数与会者的痛斥，接着，保尔上台发言，以不可容忍的激烈言辞指责党背叛了革命事业。

第二天，团省委召开紧急全会，决定将保尔和另四名同志开除出省委会。保尔同扎尔基不说话，他们属于两个不同的营垒。保尔在团支部拥有多数，他们在支部会上狠狠整了扎尔基一顿。斗争深入了，结果保尔被开除出区委会，被撤销支部书记职务。此举引起轩然大波，有二十来个人交出团证，宣布退团。最后，保尔和他的同伴被开除出团。

保尔苦恼的日子从此开始了，这是他一生中最黯淡无光的日子。

扎尔基离开公社走了。脱离了生活常规的保尔心情压抑，站在车站的天桥上，无神的目光望着下面来来往往的机车和车辆，却什么都看不见。

有人拍了拍他的肩膀。这是一个叫奥列什尼科夫的共青团员，满脸雀斑和疙疸，善于钻营，又自命不凡。保尔过去就不喜欢他。他是砖瓦厂的团支部书记。

“怎么，把你给开除了？”他问，两只白不呲咧的眼睛在保尔脸上扫来扫去。

“是。”保尔简单地回答说。

“我多次说过，”奥列什尼科夫迫不及待地接上去。“你图个什么呢？遍地都是犹太佬，他们往哪儿都钻，到处都要他们发号施令。他们才巴不得修个商亭呢。上前线打仗是你的事，他们却稳稳当当坐在家里。现在反倒把你给开除了。”他不屑地冷笑了一声。

保尔用充满仇恨的目光瞧着他，预感到要出点乱子。他控制不住自己，劈手揪住奥列什尼科夫的胸脯，怒不可遏地晃来晃去，晃得他东倒西歪。

“你这个白卫分子的鬼魂，卑鄙的妓女，你扯什么淡？你是跟谁讲这些屁话，你这个骨子里的富农？混蛋，我们城里被白军枪毙的布尔什维克，一多半都是犹太工人，你知不知道？你呀，哼！你跟谁说话？你也是反对派一伙的？这帮混蛋都该枪毙。”

奥列什尼科夫挣脱出来，没命似的跑下阶梯。保尔恶狠狠地望着他的背影。“瞧，都是些什么人赞成我们的观点！”

歌剧院里挤满了人。人们一小股一小股从各个入口走进大厅和上面的楼层。全市党团组织的联席会议要在这里举行，对党内斗争进行总结。

剧院的休息室里，大厅的过道上，大家交谈的话题是今天有一批工人反对派的成员要回到党的队伍里来。前排坐着朱赫来、丽达和扎尔基，他们也在议论这个问题。丽达回答扎尔基说：“他们会回来的。朱赫来说，已经出现转机。省委决定，只要他们检讨了错误，愿意回来，我们欢迎所有的人归队，要创造一种同志式的气氛，并且打算在即将召开的省代表大会上吸收柯察金同志参加省委，以此表示党对归队同志的真诚是信任的。我现在很激动，期待着这一刻的到来。”

会议主席摇了好一会儿铃，会场静下来以后，他说：“刚才省党委做了报告，现在由共青团里反对派的代表发言。首先发言的是柯察金同志。”

后排站起一个人，身穿保护色军便服，快步从台阶跑上讲台。他仰起头，走到台口栏杆跟前，用手摸了摸前额，仿佛在回忆什么东西，又固执地晃了晃长着鬈发的脑袋，两只手牢牢扶住栏杆。

保尔看见剧场里人坐得满登登的，他觉得几千双眼睛都在注视着他，宽敞的大厅和五个楼层都静悄悄地在盼望着。

有几秒钟的工夫，他默默地站着，努力控制自己的情绪。

他太激动了，一时不知从何说起。

离讲台不远的前排，在丽达旁边的椅子上，坐着肃反委员会主席朱赫来。他的块头可真算得是庞然大物。他正用殷切的目光望着保尔，突然微微一笑，这笑容是严峻的，又包含着鼓励。这么一副魁伟的身板，上衣的一只袖子却空空如也，因为毫无用处而塞进了口袋里。看到这幅情景，真让人心里沉甸甸的。朱赫来上衣的左口袋上，有一枚四周深红色的椭圆形红旗勋章在闪亮。

保尔把目光从前排移开。大家都在等他，他总得开口。他以临战的姿态调动起全身的精力，响亮地对整个大厅说：“同志们！”他心里涌起了波涛，感到浑身热辣辣的，又似乎大厅里点亮了千百盏吊灯，光芒烧灼着他的身体。他那热烈的话语，犹如厮杀的喊声，在大厅里震荡。话语传到数千听众的耳朵里，他们也随之激动起来。这青春的、激越的、热情洋溢的声音迸发出众多火花，飞溅到圆形屋顶下面的最高楼层的最远位子上。

“我今天想讲一讲过去。你们期待着我，我要讲一讲。我知道，我的话会使有些人心神不宁，可这大概不能叫政治宣传，这是发自内心的声音，是我以及我现在代表的所有人的心声。我想讲讲我们的生活，讲讲那一把革命的烈火，它像巨大炉膛里的煤炭，把我们点燃，使我们燃烧。我们的国家靠这烈火生存，我们的共和国靠这烈火取得了胜利。我们靠这烈火，用我们的鲜血，击溃并消灭了敌人的乌合之众。我们年轻一代和你们一起，被这烈火席卷着，去经风雨，见世面，并且更新了大地。我们一道在我们伟大的、举世无双的、钢铁般的党的旗帜下进行了坚苦卓绝的战斗。两代人，父辈和子辈，一起战死在疆场。现在，两辈人又一起来到了这里。你们期待着我们，而我们作为你们的战友，竟制造动乱来反对自己的阶级，反对自己的党，破坏党的钢铁纪律，犯下了滔天罪行。你们是想得到答案吧？我们正是如此被党赶出自己的营垒，赶到人类生活的后方，赶到偏僻的荒漠去的。

“同志们，怎么会有这样的事——我们经过革命烈火的考验，却走到了背叛革命的边缘？这事怎么发生的呢？你们都清楚我们同你们——党内多数派斗争的经过。我们这些人，在共和国最艰难的岁月里，也没有掉过队，怎么倒发动了暴乱？这究竟是怎么一回事呢？

“我们过去所受的教育，只知道对资产阶级要怀有刻骨的仇恨，所以新经济政策一来，我们便认为是反革命。其实党向新经济政策的过渡，是无产阶级同资产阶级斗争的一种新形式，只是另一种形式，从另外的角度来进行斗争，可我们却把这种过渡看作是对阶级利益的背叛。而在老一辈布尔什维克近卫军中，有那么一些人，我们青年知道他们多年从事革命工作，我们曾跟随他们前进，认为他们是真正革命的布尔什维克，现在他们也起来反对党的决定，我们就更有恃无恐，执迷不悟。显然，单有热情，单有对革命的忠心是不够的，还要善于理解大规模斗争中极其复杂的策略和战略。并非任何时候正面进攻都是正确的，有时这样的进攻恰恰是对革命事业的背叛，应该这样认识问题，我们刚刚才弄明白这一点。我们的领袖列宁同志引导国家走上了一条新的道路，就连他的名字，他的教导，也没能使我们收敛一点，可见我们的头脑发昏到了什么程度。我们为花言巧语所蒙蔽，加入了工人反对派，自以为是在为真正的革命进行正义的斗争，在共青团里

Part Two Chapter 1
---

Midnight. The last tramcar has long since dragged its battered carcass back to the depot. The moon lays its cold light on the windowsill and spreads a luminous coverlet on the bed, leaving the rest of the room in semi-darkness. At the table in the corner under a circle of light shed by the desk lamp sits Rita bent over a thick notebook, her diary. The sharp point of her pencil traces the words:

May 24

"I am making another attempt to jot down my impressions. Again there is a big gap. Six weeks have passed since I made the last entry. But it cannot be helped. 

"How can I find time for my diary? It is past midnight now, and here I am still writing. Sleep eludes me. Comrade Segal is leaving us: he is going to work in the Central Committee. We were all very much upset by the news. He is a wonderful person, our Lazar Alexandrovich. I did not realise until now how much his friendship has meant to us all. The dialectical materialism class is bound to go to pieces when he leaves. Yesterday we stayed at his place until the wee hours verifying the progress made by our 'pupils'. Akim, the Secretary of the Komsomol Gubernia Committee, came and that horrid Tufta as well. I can't stand that Mr. Know-All! Segal was delighted when his pupil Korchagin brilliantly defeated Tufta in an argument on Party history. 

Yes, these two months have not been wasted. You don't begrudge your efforts when you see such splendid results. It is rumoured that Zhukhrai is being transferred to the Special Department of the Military Region. I wonder why. 

"Lazar Alexandrovich turned his pupil over to me. 'You will have to complete what I have begun,' 

he said. 'Don't stop halfway. You and he, Rita, can learn a great deal from each other. The lad is still rather disorganised. His is a turbulent nature and he is apt to be carried away by his emotions. I feel that you will be a most suitable guide for him, Rita. I wish you success. Don't forget to write me in Moscow.' 

"Today a new secretary for the Solomensky District Committee was sent down from the Central Committee. His name is Zharky. I knew him in the army. 

"Tomorrow Dmitri Dubava will bring Korchagin. Let me try to describe Dubava. Medium height, strong, muscular. Joined the Komsomol in 1918, and has been a Party member since 1920. He was one of the three who were expelled from the Komsomol Gubernia Committee for having belonged to the 'Workers' Opposition'. Instructing him has not been easy. Every day he upset the programme by asking innumerable questions and making us digress from the subject. He and Olga Yureneva, my other pupil, did not get along at all. At their very first meeting he looked her up and down and remarked: 'Your get-up is all wrong, old girl. You ought to have trousers with leather seats, spurs, a Budyonny hat and a sabre. This way you're neither fish nor fowl.' 

"Olga wouldn't stand for that, of course, and I had to interfere. I believe Dubava is a friend of Korchagin's. Well enough for tonight. It's time for bed."

The earth wilted under the scorching sun. The iron railing of the footbridge over the railway platforms was burning to the touch. People, limp and exhausted from the heat, climbed the bridge wearily; most of them were not travellers, but residents of the railway district who used the bridge to get to the town proper. 

As he came down the steps Pavel caught sight of Rita. She had reached the station before him and was watching the people coming off the bridge. Pavel paused some three paces away from her. She did not notice him, and he studied her with new-found interest. She was wearing a striped blouse and a short dark-blue skirt of some cheap material. A soft leather jacket was slung over her shoulder. Her sun-tanned face was framed in a shock of unruly hair and as she stood there with her head thrown slightly back and her eyes narrowed against the sun's glare, it struck Korchagin for the first time that Rita, his friend and teacher, was not only a member of the bureau of the Komsomol Gubernia Committee, but.... 

Annoyed with himself for entertaining such "sinful" thoughts, he called to her. 

"I've been staring at you for a whole hour, but you didn't notice me," he laughed. "Come along, our train is already in." 

They went over to the service door leading to the platform. 

The previous day the Gubernia Committee had appointed Rita as its representative at a district conference of the Komsomol, and Korchagin was to go as her assistant.

Their immediate problem was to board the train, which was by no means a simple task. The railway station on those rare occasions when the trains ran was taken over by an all-powerful Committee of Five in charge of boarding and without a permit from this body no one was allowed on the platform. All exits and approaches to the platform were guarded by the Committee's men. The overcrowded train could take on only a fraction of the crowd anxious to leave, but no one wanted to be left behind to spend days waiting for a chance train to come through. And so thousands stormed the platform doors in an effort to break through to the unattainable carriages. In those days the station was literally besieged and sometimes pitched battles were fought. 

After vainly attempting to push through the crowd collected at the platform entrance, Pavel, who knew all the ins and outs at the station, led Rita through the luggage room. With difficulty they made their way to coach No. 4. At the carriage door a Cheka man, sweating profusely in the heat, was trying to hold back the crowd, and repeated over and over again: 

"The carriage's full, and it's against the rules to ride on the buffers or the roof." 

Irate people bore down on him, waving tickets issued by the Committee under his nose. There were angry curses, shouts and violent jostling at every carriage. Pavel saw that it would be impossible to board the train in the conventional manner. Yet board it they must, otherwise the conference would have to be called off. 

Taking Rita aside, he outlined his plan of action: he would push his way inside, open a window and help her to climb in. There was no other way. 

"Let me have that jacket of yours. It's better than any credential." 

He slipped on the jacket and stuck his revolver into the pocket so that the grip and cord showed. 

Leaving the bag with Rita, he went over to the carriage, elbowed through the knot of excited passengers at the entrance and gripped the handrail. 

"Hey, Comrade, where you going?" 

Pavel glanced nonchalantly over his shoulder at the stocky Cheka man. 

"I'm from the Special Department. I want to see whether all the passengers in this carriage have tickets issued by the Committee," he said in a tone that left no doubt as to his authority. 

The Cheka man glanced at Pavel's pocket, wiped his perspiring brow with his sleeve and said wearily: 

"Go ahead if you can shove yourself in." 

Working with his hands, shoulders, and here and there with his fists, holding on to the ledges of the upper berths to climb over the passengers who had planted themselves on their belongings in the middle of the passage, Pavel made his way through to the centre of the carriage, ignoring the torrent of abuse that rained down on him from all sides. 

"Can't you look where you're going, curse you!" screamed a stout woman when Pavel accidentally brushed her knee with his foot, as he lowered himself to the floor. She had contrived to wedge her 18-stone bulk onto the edge of a seat and had a large vegetable oil can between her knees. All the shelves were stuffed with similar cans, hampers, sacks and baskets. The air in the carriage was suffocating. 

Paying no heed to the abuse, Pavel demanded: "Your ticket, please!" 

"My what!" the woman snapped back at the unwelcome ticket-collector. 

A head appeared from the uppermost berth and an ugly voice boomed out: "Vaska, what's this 'ere mug want. Give 'im a ticket to kingdom come, will ya?" 

The huge frame and hairy chest of what was obviously Vaska swung into view right above Pavel's head and a pair of bloodshot eyes fixed him with a bovine stare. 

"Leave the lady alone, can't ya? What d'ye want tickets for?" 

Four pairs of legs dangled from an upper side berth; their owners sat with their arms around one another's shoulders noisily cracking sunflower seeds. One glance at their faces told Pavel who they were: a gang of food sharks, hardened crooks who travelled up and down the country buying up food and selling it at speculative prices.

Pavel had no time to waste with them. He had to get Rita inside somehow. 

"Whose box is this?" he inquired of an elderly man in railway uniform, indicating a wooden chest standing under the window. 

"Hers," replied the other, pointing to a pair of thick legs in brown stockings. 

The window had to be opened and the box was in the way. Since there was nowhere to move it Pavel picked it up and handed it to its owner who was seated on an upper berth. 

"Hold it a moment, please, I'm going to open the window." 

"Keep your hands off my things!" screamed the flat-nosed wench when he placed the box on her knees. 

"Motka, what's this feller think he's doin'?" she said to the man seated beside her. The latter gave Pavel a kick in the back with his sandalled foot. 

"Lissen 'ere, you! Clear out of here before I punch your nose!" 

Pavel endured the kick in silence. He was too busy unfastening the window. 

"Move aside, please," he said to the railwayman. 

Shifting another can out of the way Pavel cleared a space in front of the window. Rita was on the platform below. Quickly she handed him the bag. Throwing it onto the knees of the stout woman with the vegetable oil can, Pavel bent down, seized Rita's hands and drew her in. Before the guard had time to notice this infringement of the rules, Rita was inside the carriage, leaving the guard swearing belatedly outside. The gang of toughs met Rita's appearance with such an uproar that she was taken aback. Since there was not even standing room on the floor, she found a place for her feet on the very edge of the lower berth and stood there holding on to the upper berth for support. 

Foul curses sounded on all sides. From above the ugly bass voice croaked: 

"Look at the swine, gets in himself and drags his broad in after 'im!" 

A voice from above squeaked: "Motka, poke him one between the eyes!" 

The woman was doing her best to stand her wooden box on Pavel's head. The two newcomers were surrounded by a ring of evil, brutish faces. Pavel was sorry that Rita had to be exposed to this but there was nothing to be done but to make the best of it. 

"Move your sacks and make room for the comrade," he said to the one they called Motka, but the answer was a curse so foul that he boiled with rage. The pulse over his right eyebrow began to throb painfully. "Just wait, you scoundrel, you'll answer for this," he said to the ruffian, but received a kick on the head from above.

"Good for you, Vaska, fetch 'im another!" came approving cries from all sides.

Pavel's self-control gave way at last, and as always in such moments his actions became swift and sure.

"You speculating bastards, you think you can get away with it?" he shouted, and hoisting himself agilely on to the upper berth, he sent his fist smashing against Motka's leering face. The speculator went tumbling onto the heads of the other passengers.

"Clear out of here, you swine, or I'll shoot down the whole lot of you!" Pavel yelled, waving his revolver under the noses of the four.

The tables were turned. Rita watched closely, ready to shoot if anyone attacked Korchagin. The upper berth-quickly cleared. The gang hastily withdrew to the neighbouring compartment.

As he helped Rita up to the empty berth, Pavel whispered:

"You stay here, I'm going to see about those fellows."

Rita tried to stop him. "You're not going to fight them, are you?"

"No," he reassured her. "I'll be back soon."

He opened the window again and climbed out onto the platform. A few minutes later he was talking to Burmeister of the Transport Cheka, his former chief. The Lett heard him out and then gave orders to have the entire carriage cleared and the passengers' papers checked.

"It's just as I said," growled Burmeister. "The trains are full of speculators before they get here."

A detail of ten Cheka men cleared the carriage. Pavel, assuming his old duties, helped to examine the documents of the passengers. He had not broken all ties with his former Cheka comrades and in his capacity as secretary of the Komsomol he had sent some of the best Komsomol members to work there. When the screening was over, Pavel returned to Rita. The carriage was now occupied by a vastly different type of passenger: Red Army men and factory and office workers travelling on business.

Rita and Pavel had the top berth in one corner of the carriage, but so much of it was taken up with bundles of newspapers that there was only room for Rita to lie down.

"Never mind," she said, "we'll manage somehow."

The train began to move at last. As it slid slowly out of the station they caught a brief glimpse of the fat woman seated on a bundle of sacks on the platform and heard her yelling:

"Hey Manka, where's my oil can gone?"

Sitting in their cramped quarters with the bundles of newspapers shielding them from their neighbours, Pavel and Rita munched bread and apples and laughingly recalled the far from laughable episode with which their journey had begun.

The train crawled along. The old, battered and overloaded carriage creaked and groaned and trembled violently at every joint in the track. The deep blue twilight looked in at the windows.

Then night came, folding the carriage in darkness.

Rita was tired and she dozed with her head resting on the bag. Pavel sat on the edge of the berth and smoked. He too was tired but there was no room to lie down. The fresh night breeze blew through the open window.

Rita, awakened by a sudden jolt, saw the glow of Pavel's cigarette in the darkness. It was just like him to sit up all night rather than cause her discomfort.

"Comrade Korchagin! Drop those bourgeois conventions and lie down," she said lightly.

Pavel obediently lay down beside her and stretched his stiff legs luxuriously.

"We have heaps of work tomorrow. So try and get some sleep, you rowdy." She put her arm trustingly around his neck and he felt her hair touching his cheek.

To Pavel, Rita was sacred. She was his friend and comrade, his political guide. Yet she was a woman as well. He had first become aware of this over there at the footbridge, and that was why her embrace stirred him so much now. He felt her deep even breathing; somewhere quite close to him were her lips. Proximity awoke in him a powerful desire to find those lips, and it was only with a great effort of will that he suppressed the impulse.

Rita, as if divining his feelings, smiled in the darkness. She had already known the joy of passion and the pain of loss. She had given her love to two Bolsheviks.

Whiteguard bullets had robbed her of both. One had been a splendid giant of a man, a Brigade Commander; the other, a lad with clear blue eyes.

Soon the regular rhythm of the wheels rocked Pavel to sleep and he did not wake until the engine whistled shrilly the next morning.

Work kept Rita occupied every day until late at night and she had little time for her diary. After an interval a few more brief entries appeared:

August 11

"The gubernia conference is over. Akim, Mikhailo and several others have gone to Kharkov for the all-Ukraine conference, leaving all the paper work to me. Dubava and Pavel have been sent to work at the Gubernia Committee. Ever since Dmitri was made secretary of the Pechorsk District Committee he has stopped coming to lessons. He is up to his neck in work. Pavel tries to do some studying, but we don't get much done because either I am too busy or else he is sent off on some assignment. With the present tense situation on the railways the Komsomols are constantly being mobilised for work. Zharky came to see me yesterday. He complained about the boys being takenaway from him, says he needs them badly himself."

August 23

"I was going down the corridor today when I saw Korchagin standing outside the manager's office with Pankratov and another man. As I came closer I heard Pavel say:

" 'Those fellows sitting there ought to be shot. "You've no right to countermand our orders," he says. "The Railway Firewood Committee is the boss here and you Komsomols had better keep out of it." You ought to have seen his mug.... And the place is infested with parasites like him!' He followed this up with some shocking

language. Pankratov caught sight of me and nudged him. Pavel swung round and when he saw me he turned pale and walked off without meeting my eyes.

He won't be coming around for a long while now. He knows I will not tolerate bad language."

August 27

"We had a closed meeting of the bureau. The situation is becoming serious. I cannot write about it in detail just yet. Akim came back from the regional conference looking very worried. Yesterday another supply train was derailed. I don't think I shall try to keep this diary any more. It is much too haphazard anyway. I am expecting Korchagin. I saw him the other day and he told me he and Zharky are organising a commune of five."

One day while at work in the railway shops Pavel was called to the telephone. It was Rita. She happened to be free that evening and suggested that they finish the chapter they had been studying — the reasons for the fall of the Paris Commune. 

As he approached Rita's house on University Street that evening, Pavel glanced up and saw a light in her window. He ran upstairs, gave his usual brief knock on the door and went in. There on the bed, where none of the young comrades were allowed even to sit for a moment, lay a man in uniform. A revolver, knapsack and cap with the red star lay on the table. Rita was sitting beside the stranger with her arms clasped tightly around him. The two were engaged in earnest conversation and as Pavel entered Rita looked up with a radiant face. 

The man freed himself from her embrace and rose. 

"Pavel," said Rita shaking hands with him, "this is ...." 

"David Ustinovich," the man said, clasping Korchagin's hand warmly. 

"He turned up quite unexpectedly," Rita explained with a happy laugh. 

Pavel shook hands coldly with the newcomer and a gleam of resentment flashed in his eyes. He noticed the four squares of a Company Commander on the sleeve of the man's uniform. 

Rita was about to say something but Pavel interrupted her. "I just dropped in to tell you that I shall be busy loading wood down at the wharves this evening," he said.

"And anyhow you have a visitor. Well, I'll be off, the boys are waiting for me downstairs." 

And he disappeared through the door as suddenly _ as he had come. They heard him hurrying down the stairs. Then the outside door slammed and all was quiet. 

"There's something the matter with him," Rita faltered in answer to David's questioning look. 

Down below under the bridge an engine heaved a deep sigh, exhaling a shower of golden sparks from its mighty lungs. They soared upward executing a fantastic dance and were lost in the smoke. 

Pavel leaned against the railing and stared at the coloured signal lights winking on the switches. 

He screwed up his eyes. 

"What I don't understand, Comrade Korchagin, is why it should hurt so much to discover that Rita has a husband? Has she ever told you she hadn't? And even if she has, what of it? Why should you take it like that? You thought, Comrade, it was all platonic friendship and nothing else. ... How could you have let this happen?" he asked himself with bitter irony. "But what if he isn't her husband? David Ustinovich might be her brother or her uncle.... In which case you've done the chap an injustice, you fool. You're no better than any other swine. It's easy enough to find out whether he's her brother or not. Suppose he turns out to be a brother or an uncle, how are you going to face her after the way you've behaved? No, you've got to stop seeing her!"

The scream of an engine whistle interrupted his reflections.

"It's getting late. Time to be going home. Enough of this nonsense."

At Solomenka, as the district where the railway workers lived was called, five young men set up a miniature commune. They were Zharky, Pavel, Klavicek, a jolly fair-haired Czech, Nikolai Okunev, secretary of the railway-yards Komsomol, and Stepan Artyukhin, a boiler repairman who was now working for the railway Cheka.

They found a room and for three days spent all their free time cleaning, painting and whitewashing. They dashed back and forth with pails so many times that the neighbours thought the house was on fire. They made themselves bunks, and mattresses filled with maple leaves gathered in the park, and on the fourth day the room, with a portrait of Petrovsky and a huge map on the wall, literally shone with cleanliness.

Between the windows was a shelf piled high with books. Two crates covered with cardboard served for chairs, another larger crate did duty as a cupboard. In the middle of the room stood a huge billiard table, minus the cloth, which the room's inmates had carried on their shoulders from the warehouse. By day it was used as a table and at night Klavicek slept on it. The five lads fetched all their belongings, and the practical-minded Klavicek made an inventory of the commune's possessions. He wanted to hang it up on the wall but the others objected. Everything in the room was declared common property. Earnings, rations and occasional parcels from home were all divided equally; the sole items of personal property were their weapons. It was unanimously decided that any member of the commune who violated the law of communal ownership or who betrayed his comrades' trust would be expelled from the commune. Okunev and Klavicek insisted that expulsion should be followed by eviction from the room, and the motion was carried.

All the active members of the District Komsomol came to the commune's house-warming party. A gigantic samovar was borrowed from the next-door neighbour. The tea party consumed the commune's entire stock of saccharine. After tea, they sang in chorus and their lusty young voices rocked the rafters:

The whole wide world is drenched with tears,

In bitter toil our days are passed,

But, wait, the radiant dawn appears....

Talya Lagutina, the girl from the tobacco factory, led the singing. Her crimson kerchief had slipped to one side of her head and her eyes, whose depths none as yet had fathomed, danced with mischief. Talya had a most infectious laugh and she looked at the world from the radiant height of her eighteen years. Now her arm swept up and the singing poured forth like a fanfare of trumpets:

Spread, our song, o'er the world like a flood,Proudly our flag waves unfurled.

It burns and glows throughout the world,On fire from our heart's blood.

The party broke up late and the silent streets awoke to the echo of their young voices.

The telephone rang and Zharky reached for the receiver.

"Keep quiet, I can't hear anything!" he shouted to the noisy Komsomols who had crowded in the Secretary's office.

The hubbub subsided somewhat.

"Hullo! Ah, it's you. Yes, right away. What's on the agenda? Oh, the same old thing, hauling firewood from the wharves. What's that? No, he's not been sent anywhere.

He's here. Want to speak to him? Just a minute."

Zharky beckoned to Pavel.

"Comrade Ustinovich wants to speak to you," he said and handed him the receiver.

"I thought you were out of town," Pavel heard Rita's voice say. "I happen to be free this evening.

Why don't you come over? My brother has gone. He was just passing through town and decided to look me up. We haven't seen each other for two years."

Her brother!

Pavel did not hear any more. He was recalling that unfortunate evening and the resolve he had taken that night down on the bridge. Yes, he must go to her this evening and put an end to this.

Love brought too much pain and anxiety with it. Was this the time for such things?

The voice in his ear said: "Can't you hear me?"

"Yes, yes. I hear you. Very well. I'll come over after the Bureau meeting." And he hung up.

He looked her straight in the eyes and, gripping the edge of the oak table, he said: "I don't think I'll be able to come and see you any more." He saw her thick eyelashes sweep upward at his words.

Her pencil paused in its flight over the page and then lay motionless on the open pad.

"Why not?"

"It's very hard for me to find the time. You know yourself we're not having it so easy just now. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we'll have to call it off...."

He was conscious that the last few words sounded none too firm.

"What are you beating about the bush for?" he raged inwardly. "You haven't the courage to strike out with both fists."

Aloud he went on: "Besides, I've been wanting to tell you for some time — I have difficulty in grasping your explanations. When we studied with Segal what I learned stayed in my head somehow, but with you it doesn't. I've always had to go to Tokarev after our lessons and get him to explain things properly. It's my fault — my noodle just can't take it. You'll have to find some pupil with a bit more brains."

He turned away from her searching gaze, and, deliberately burning all his bridges, added doggedly: "So you see it would just be a waste of time for us to continue."

Then he got up, moved the chair aside carefully with his foot and looked at the bowed head and the face that turned pale in the light of the lamp. He put on his cap.

"Well, good-bye, Comrade Rita. Sorry I've wasted so much of your time. I ought to have told you long before this. That's where I'm to blame."

Rita mechanically gave him her hand, but she was too stunned by his sudden coldness to say more than a few words. 

"I don't blame you, Pavel. If I haven't succeeded in finding some way of making things clear to you I deserve this." 

Pavel walked heavily to the door. He closed it after him softly. Downstairs he paused for a moment — it was not too late to go back and explain.... But what was the use? For what? To hear her scornful response and find himself outside again? No.

Graveyards of dilapidated railway carriages and abandoned engines grew on the sidings. The wind whirled and scattered the dry sawdust in the deserted woodyards. 

And all around the town in the forest thickets and deep ravines lurked Orlik's band. By day they lay low in surrounding hamlets or in wooded tracts, but at night they crept out onto the railway tracks, tore them up ruthlessly and, their evil work done, crawled back again into their lair. 

And many an iron steed went crashing down the railway embankment. Boxcars were smashed to smithereens, sleepy humans were flattened like pancakes beneath the wreckage, and precious grain mingled with blood and earth. 

The band would swoop down suddenly on some small town scattering the frightened, clucking hens in all directions. A few shots would be fired at random. Outside the building of the Volost Soviet there would be a brief crackle of rifle fire, like the sound of bracken underfoot, and the bandits would dash about the village on their well-fed horses cutting down everyone who crossed their path. They hacked at their victims as calmly as if they were splitting logs. Rarely did they shoot, for bullets were scarce.

The band would be gone as swiftly as it had come. It had its eyes and ears everywhere. Those eyes saw through the walls of the small white building that housed the Volost Soviet, for invisible threads led from the priest's house and the kulaks' cottages to the forest thickets. Cases of ammunition, chunks of fresh pork, bottles of bluish raw spirit went the same way, also news that was whispered into the ears of the lesser atamans and then passed on by devious routes to Orlik himself. 

Though it consisted of no more than two or three hundred cutthroats, the band had so far eluded capture. It would split up into several small units and operate in two or three districts simultaneously. It was impossible to catch all of them. Last night's bandit would next day appear as a peaceful peasant pottering in his garden, feeding his horse or standing at his gate puffing smugly at his pipe and watching the cavalry patrols ride by with a sly look in his eyes. 

Alexander Puzyrevsky with his regiment chased the bandits up and down the three districts with dogged persistence. Occasionally he did succeed in treading on their tail; a month later Orlik was obliged to withdraw his gangs from two of the districts, and now he was hemmed in on a narrow strip of territory.

Life in the town jogged along at its customary pace. Noisy crowds swarmed its five markets. Two impulses dominated the milling throngs — to grab as much as possible, and to give as little as possible. This environment offered unlimited scope for the energy and abilities of all manner of sharks and swindlers. Hundreds of slippery individuals with eyes that expressed everything but honesty snooped about among the crowds. All the scum of the town gathered here like flies on a dunghill, moved by a single purpose: to hoodwink the gullible. The few trains that came this way spewed out gobs of sack-laden people who made at once for the markets. 

At night the market places were deserted, and the dark rows of booths and stalls looked sinister and menacing. 

It was the bold man who would venture after dark into this desolate quarter where danger lurked behind every stall. And often by night a shot would ring out like the clang of a hammer on iron, and some throat would choke on its own blood. And by the time the handful of militiamen from the nearest beats would reach the spot (they did not venture out alone) they would find nothing but the mutilated corpse. The killers had taken to their heels and the commotion had swept away the few nocturnal habitués of the market square like a gust of wind. Opposite the market place was the "Orion" cinema. The street and pavement were flooded with electric light and people crowded around the entrance. Inside the hall the movie projector clicked, flashing melodramatic love scenes onto the screen; now and then the film snapped and the operator stopped the projector amid roars of disapproval from the audience. 

In the centre of the town and on the outskirts life appeared to be taking its usual course. Even in the Gubernia Committee of the Party, the nerve centre of revolutionary authority, everything was quiet. But this was merely an outward calm. 

A storm was brewing in the town. Many of those who came there from various directions, with their army rifles plainly visible under their long peasant overcoats, were aware of its coming. So did those who under the guise of food speculators arrived on the roofs of trains, but instead of carrying their sacks to the market took them to carefully memorised addresses. 

These knew. But the workers' districts, and even Bolsheviks, had no inkling of the approaching storm. 

Only five Bolsheviks in town knew what was being plotted. 

Closely co-operating with foreign missions in Warsaw, the remnants of Petlyura's bands which the Red Army had driven into White Poland were preparing to take part in the uprising. A raiding force was being formed of what remained of Petlyura's regiments. 

The central committee of the insurgents had an organisation in Shepetovka; it consisted of forty-seven members, most of them former active counter-revolutionaries whom the local Cheka had trustingly left at liberty. 

Father Vasili, Ensign Vinnik, and Kuzmenko, a Petlyura officer, were the leaders of the organisation. The priest's daughters, Vinnik's father and brother, and a man named Samotinya who had wormed his way into the office of the Executive Committee did the spying. 

The plan was to attack the frontier Special Department by night with hand grenades, release the prisoners and, if possible, seize the railway station. 

Meanwhile officers were being secretly concentrated in the city which was to be the hub of the uprising, and bandit gangs were being moved into the neighbouring forests. From here, contact with Rumania and with Petlyura himself was maintained through trusted agents.

Fyodor Zhukhrai, in his office at the Special Department, had not slept for six nights. He was one of the five Bolsheviks who were aware of what was brewing. The ex-sailor was now experiencing the sensation of the big game hunter who has tracked down his prey and is now waiting for the beast to spring. 

He dare not shout or raise the alarm. The bloodthirsty monster must be slain. Then and then only would it be possible to work in peace, without having to glance fearfully behind every bush. The beast must not be scared away. In a life and death struggle such as this it is endurance and firmness that win the day. 

The crucial moment was at hand. Somewhere in the town amidst the labyrinth of conspiratorial hide-outs the time had been set: tomorrow night. 

But the five Bolsheviks who knew decided to strike first. The time was tonight. 

The same evening an armoured train slid quietly out of the railway yards and the massive gates closed as quietly behind it. 

Coded telegrams flew over the wires and in response to their urgent summons the alert and watchful men to whom the republic's security had been entrusted took immediate steps to stamp out the hornet's nests. 

Akim telephoned to Zharky. 

"Cell meetings in order? Good. Come over here at once for a conference and bring the Party District Committee Secretary with you. The fuel problem is worse than we thought. We'll discuss the details when you get here." Akim spoke in a firm, hurried voice.

"This firewood business is driving us all potty," Zharky growled back into the receiver. 

Litke drove the two secretaries over to headquarters at breakneck speed. As they ascended the stairs to the first floor they saw at once that they had not been summoned here to talk about firewood. 

On the office manager's desk stood a machine-gun and gunners from the Special Task Unit were busy beside it. Silent guards from the town's Party and Komsomol organisations stood in the corridors. Behind the wide doors of the Secretary's office an emergency session of the Bureau of the Party Gubernia Committee was drawing to a close. 

Through a fanlight giving onto the street wires led to two field telephones. There was a subdued hum of conversation in the room. Akim, Rita and Mikhailo were there, Rita in a Red Army helmet, khaki skirt, leather jacket with a heavy Mauser strapped on to it — the uniform she used to wear at the front when she had been Company political Instructor. 

"What's all this about?" Zharky asked her in surprise. 

"Alert drill, Vanya. We're going to your district right away. We are to meet at the Fifth Infantry School. The Komsomols are going there straight from their cell meetings. The main thing is to get there without attracting attention." 

The grounds of the old military school with its giant old oaks, its stagnant pond overgrown with burdock and nettles and its broad unswept paths were wrapped in silence. 

In the centre of the grounds behind a high white wall stood the school building, now the premises of the Fifth Infantry School for Red Army commanders. It was late at night. The upper floor of the building was dark. Outwardly all was serene, and the chance passerby would have thought that the school's inmates were asleep. Why, then, were the iron gates open, and what were those two dark shapes like monster toads standing by the entrance? The people who gathered here from all parts of the railway district knew that the school's inmates could not be asleep, once a night alert had been given. They were coming straight from their Komsomol and Party cell meetings where the brief announcement had been made; they came quietly, individually, in pairs, never more than three together, and each of them carried the Communist Party or Komsomol membership card, without which no one could pass through the iron gates. 

The assembly hall, where a large crowd had already gathered, was flooded with light. The windows were heavily curtained with thick canvas tenting. The Bolsheviks who had been summoned here stood about calmly smoking their homemade cigarettes and cracking jokes about the precautions taken for a drill. No one felt this was a real alert; it was being done to maintain discipline in the special task detachments. The seasoned soldier, however, recognised the signs of a genuine alert as soon as he entered the schoolyard. Far too much caution was being displayed. 

Platoons of students were lining up outside to whispered commands. Machine-guns were being carried quietly into the yard and not a chink of light showed in any of the windows of the building. 

"Something serious in the wind, Mityai?" Pavel Korchagin inquired of Dubava, who was sitting on a windowsill next to a girl Pavel remembered seeing a couple of days before at Zharky's place. 

Dubava clapped Pavel good-humouredly on the shoulder. 

"Getting cold feet, eh? Never mind, we'll teach you fellows how to fight. You don't know each other, do you?" he nodded toward the girl. "This is Anna, don't know her second name, she's in charge of the agitation and propaganda centre." 

The girl thus introduced regarded Korchagin with interest and pushed back a wisp of hair that had escaped from under her violet kerchief. Korchagin's eyes met hers and for a moment or two a silent contest ensued. Her sparking jet-black eyes under their sweeping lashes challenged his. 

Pavel shifted his gaze to Dubava. Conscious that he was blushing, he scowled. "Which of you does the agitating?" he inquired forcing a smile. 

At that moment there was a stir in the hall. A Company Commander climbed onto a chair and shouted: "Members of the first company, line up. Hurry, Comrades, hurry!" 

Zhukhrai entered with the Chairman of the Gubernia Executive Committee and Akim. They had just arrived. The hall was now filled from end to end with people lined up in formation. 

The Chairman of the Gubernia Executive Committee stepped onto the mounting of a training machine-gun and raised his hand. 

"Comrades," he said, "you have been summoned here on an extremely serious and urgent matter. 

What I am going to tell you now could not have been told even yesterday for security reasons. 

Tomorrow night a counterrevolutionary uprising is scheduled to break out in this and other towns of the Ukraine. The town is full of Whiteguard officers. Bandit units have been concentrated all around the town. Part of the conspirators have penetrated into the armoured car detachment and are working there as drivers. But the Cheka has uncovered the plot in good time and we are putting the entire Party and Komsomol organisations under arms. The first and second Communist battalions will operate together with the military school units and Cheka detachments. The military school units have already gone into action. It is now your turn, Comrades. You have fifteen minutes to get your weapons and line up. Comrade Zhukhrai will be in command of the operation. The unit commanders will take their orders from him. I need hardly stress the gravity of the situation. Tomorrow's insurrection must be averted today."

A quarter of an hour later the armed battalion was lined up in the schoolyard. 

Zhukhrai ran his eye over the motionless ranks. Three paces in front of them stood two men girded with leather belts: Battalion Commander Menyailo, a foundry worker, a giant of a man from the Urals, and beside him Commissar Akim. To the left were the platoons of the first company, with the company commander and political instructor two paces in front. Behind them stood the silent ranks of the Communist battalion, three hundred strong. Fyodor gave the signal. "Time to begin."

The three hundred men marched through the deserted streets. 

The city slept. 

On Lvovskaya Street, opposite Dikaya, the battalion broke ranks. 

Noiselessly they surrounded the buildings. Headquarters was set up on the steps of a shop. 

An automobile came speeding down Lvovskaya Street from the direction of the centre, its headlights cutting a bright path before it. It pulled up sharply in front of the battalion command post. 

Hugo Litke had brought his father this time. The commandant sprang out of the car, throwing a few clipped Lettish sentences over his shoulder to his son. The car leapt forward and disappeared in a flash around the bend of the road. Litke, his hands gripping the steering wheel as though part of it, his eyes glued to the road, drove like a devil. Yes, there was need of Litke's wild driving tonight. He was hardly likely to get two nights in the guardhouse for speeding now! 

And Hugo flew down the streets like a meteor. 

Zhukhrai, whom young Litke drove from one end of town to the other in the twinkling of an eye, remarked approvingly: "If you don't knock anyone down tonight you'll get

a gold watch tomorrow." 

Hugo was jubilant. "I thought I'd get ten days in jail for that corner...." 

The first blows were struck at the conspirators' headquarters. Before long groups of prisoners and batches of documents were being delivered to the Special Department. 

In house No. 11 on Dikaya Street lived one Zurbert who, according to information in possession of the Cheka, had played no small part in the Whiteguard plot. The lists of the officers' units that were to operate in the Podol area were in his keeping. 

Litke senior himself came to Dikaya Street to make the arrest. The windows of Zurbert's apartment looked out onto a garden which was separated from a former nunnery by a high wall. Zurbert was not at home. The neighbours said that he had not been seen at all that day. A search was made and, the lists of names and addresses were found, together with a case of hand grenades. 

Litke, having ordered an ambush to be set, lingered for a moment in the room to examine the papers. 

The young military school student on sentry duty in the garden below could see the lighted window from the corner of the garden where he was stationed. It was a little frightening to stand there alone in the dark. He had been told to keep an eye on the wall. The comforting light seemed very far from his post. And to make matters worse, the moon kept darting behind the clouds. In the night the bushes seemed to be invested with a sinister life of their own. The young soldier stabbed at the darkness around him with his bayonet. Nothingness.

"Why did they put me here? No one could climb that wall anyhow, it's far too high. I think I'll go over to the window and peep in." Glancing up again at the wall, he emerged from his dank, fungus-smelling corner. As he came up to the window, Litke picked up the papers from the table. 

At that moment a shadow appeared on top of the wall whence both the sentry by the window and the man inside the room were clearly visible. With catlike agility the shadow swung itself onto a tree and dropped down to the ground. Stealthily it crept up to its victim. A single blow and the sentry was sprawled on the ground with a naval dirk driven up to the hilt into his neck. 

A shot rang out in the garden galvanising the men surrounding the block. Six of them ran toward the house, their steps ringing loudly in the night. Litke sat slumped forward over the table, the blood pouring from the wound in his head. He was dead. The window pane was shattered. But the assassin had not had time to seize the documents. 

Several more shots were heard behind the nunnery wall. The murderer had climbed over the wall to the street and was now shooting his way out, trying to escape by way of the Lukyanov vacant lot. But a bullet cut short his flight. 

All night long the searches continued. Hundreds of people not registered in the books of the house committees and found in possession of suspicious documents and carrying weapons were dispatched to the Cheka, where a commission was at work screening the suspects. 

Here and there the conspirators fought back. During the search in a house on Zhilyanskaya Street Anton Lebedev was killed by a shot fired point-blank. 

The Solomenka battalion lost five men that night, and the Cheka lost Jan Litke, that staunch Bolshevik and faithful guardian of the republic. 

But the Whiteguard uprising was nipped in the bud. 

That same night Father Vasili with his daughters and the rest of the gang were arrested in Shepetovka. 

The tension relaxed. But soon a new enemy threatened the town: paralysis of the railways, which meant starvation and cold in the coming winter. 

Everything now depended on grain and firewood.

　　午夜。最后一辆电车早已拖着破旧的车厢回库了。淡淡的月光照着窗台，也照在床上，像是铺了一条浅蓝色的床单。

　　房间的其他地方仍旧是黑糊糊的，只有墙角的桌子上点着台灯，射出一圈亮光。丽达低着头，在一本厚厚的笔记本上写日记。

　　削得尖尖的铅笔迅速移动着：

　　５月２４日

　　我又想把自己的一些印象记下来。前面又是一段空白，一个半月过去了，一个字也没有写，只好就这样空着了。

　　哪里找得出时间来写日记呢？现在夜已深了，我才能坐下来写。一点睡意也没有。谢加尔同志就要调到中央委员会去工作。知道这个消息后，大家都很难过。他真是我们的好同志。现在我才体会到，他和大家的友谊是多么深厚，多么宝贵。谢加尔一走，辩证唯物主义学习小组自然就要散了。昨天我们在他那里一直待到深夜，检查了我们的“辅导对象”的学习成绩。共青团省委书记阿基姆也来了，还有那个令人讨厌的登记分配部部长图夫塔。这个万事通简直叫人受不了！谢加尔高兴极了，因为谈到党史的时候，他的学生柯察金把图夫塔驳得哑口无言。的确，这两个月的时间没有白费。既然学习效果这么好，付出的心血就不可惜了。听说朱赫来要调到军区特勤部去工作。为什么要调动，我不知道。

　　谢加尔把他的学生交给了我。

　　“您替我接着带下去吧，”他说。“不要半途而废。丽达，无论是您，还是他，都有值得互相学习的地方。这个年轻人还没有摆脱自发性。他还是凭着他那奔放的感情生活的，而这种旋风似的感情常常使他走弯路。丽达，根据我对您的了解，您会是他的一个最合适的指导员。我祝你成功。别忘了给我往莫斯科去信。”临别的时候，他对我这样说。

　　团中央新委派的索洛缅卡区委书记扎尔基今天来了。在部队里我就认识他。

　　明天德米特里·杜巴瓦带柯察金来学习。现在我把杜巴瓦描写一下。他中等身材，身强力壮，肌肉很发达。一九一八年入团，一九二○年入党。他是因为参加“工人反对派”而被开除出共青团省委的三个委员当中的一个。辅导他学习可真不容易。每天他都打乱计划，向我提出一大堆不着边际的问题。他同我的另一个学生奥莉加·尤列涅娃经常发生争执。

　　第一次学习的那天晚上，他就把奥莉加从头到脚打量一番，说：“我说老太婆，你的军装不齐全。还缺皮裆马裤、马刺、布琼尼帽和马刀，就现在这样文不文武不武的，像什么样！”

　　奥莉加也不示弱，我只好从中调解。杜巴瓦可能是柯察金的朋友。今天就写这些，该睡觉了。

　　骄阳似火，烤得大地懒洋洋的。车站天桥的铁栏杆晒得滚烫。热得无精打采的人们慢腾腾地向上走着。这些人不是旅客，多半是从索洛缅卡铁路工人区到城里去的。

　　保尔从天桥上边的台阶上看见了丽达。她已经先到了，正在下面看着从天桥上走下来的人群。

　　保尔走到丽达旁边，离她还有两三步，就站住了。她没有发觉他。保尔怀着一种少有的好奇心观察她。丽达穿着一件条纹衬衫，下面是蓝布短裙，一件柔软的皮夹克搭在肩膀上。蓬松的头发衬托着她那晒得黝黑的脸庞。丽达站在那里，微微仰着头，强烈的阳光照得她眯起了眼睛。保尔还是第一次用这样的眼光观察他的这位朋友和老师，也是第一次突然意识到，丽达不仅是团省委的一名常委，而且……但是，他立即抓住了自己的“恶念”，责备这种念头很荒唐，于是赶紧招呼她：“我已经整整看了你一个钟头，你还没有看见我。该走了吧，火车已经进站了。”

　　他们走到了通站台的通勤口。

　　昨天，省委决定派丽达代表省委去出席一个县的团代表大会，让保尔协助她工作。他们今天必须乘车出发。这可不是一件容易的事。因为车次太少，发车的时候，车站就由掌握全权的五人小组控制。没有这个小组发的通行证，任何人都无权进站。所有的进出口全由这个小组派出的值勤队把守着。一列火车就是挤破车厢，也只能运走十分之一急着上路的旅客。谁也不愿意等下一趟车，因为行车时间没有准儿，说不定一等就是几天。几千个人都往检票口拥，都想冲过去，挤到眼巴巴等了很久的绿色车厢里去。这些日子，车站被围得水泄不通，到处是人，常常发生扭打的事。

　　保尔和丽达挤来挤去，怎么也进不了站台。

　　保尔对车站的情况很熟悉，知道所有的进出通道，他就领丽达从行李房进了站台。费了好大劲，总算挤到了四号车厢跟前。车门前乱哄哄地拥着一堆人，一个热得满头大汗的肃反工作人员拦住车门，上百次地重复着一句话：“不是跟你们说了吗？车厢里挤得满满的了。车厢的连接板上和车顶上不许站人，这是上头的命令。”

　　人们发疯似的冲着他挤去，都把五人小组发的四号车厢乘车证伸到他鼻子跟前。每节车厢的门前都是这样，人们气势汹汹地咒骂着，喊叫着，往上挤。保尔看出来，照常规办事是根本上不了车的。但是，他们又非上去不可，否则，代表大会就不能按期召开了。

　　他把丽达叫到一边，把自己的打算告诉了她：他先挤进车厢去，然后打开车窗，把她从窗口拉进去。不这样，就没有别的办法。

　　“把你的皮夹克给我，它比什么证件都管用。”

　　保尔拿过她的皮夹克穿上，又把手枪往夹克口袋里一插，故意让枪柄和枪穗露在外面。他把装食物的旅行袋放在丽达脚下，走到车门跟前，毫不客气地分开旅客，一只手抓住了车门把手。

　　“喂，同志，往哪儿去？”

　　保尔回头看了看那个矮墩墩的肃反工作人员。

　　“我是军区特勤部的。现在要检查一下，车上的人是不是都有五人小组发的乘车证。”保尔煞有介事地说，他的口气不容许别人对他的权力有丝毫怀疑。

　　那个工作人员看了看他口袋里的手枪，用袖口擦掉额上的汗珠，用无所谓的语调说：“好吧，你只要能挤进去，就检查好了。”

　　保尔用胳膊、肩膀，甚至拳头给自己开路，拼命往里挤，有时抓住上层的铺位，把身子吊起来，从别人肩膀上爬过去。

　　他受到了数不清的咒骂，不过总算挤到了车厢的中间。

　　他从上面下来，一脚踩在一个胖女人的膝盖上，她冲着他骂起来：“你这个该死的，臭脚丫子往哪儿伸呀！”这女人像个大肉球，约摸有七普特［一普特等于１６．３８千克。——译者］，勉勉强强挤在下铺的边缘上，两条腿中间还夹着一只装黄油的铁桶。各式各样的铁桶、箱子、口袋、筐子塞满了所有的铺位。车厢里闷得使人喘不过气来。

　　保尔没有理睬这个胖女人的咒骂，只是问她：“您的乘车证呢，公民？”

　　“什么？”她对这个突然冒出来的检票员恶狠狠地反问了一句。

　　一个贼眉鼠眼的家伙从上面的铺位上探出头来，扯着粗嗓子喊：“瓦西卡，这小子是个什么玩意儿？打发他滚远点！”

　　一个人应声在保尔的头顶上出现了。看来这就是瓦西卡了。这小子又高又大，胸脯上全是毛，两只牛眼睛瞪着柯察金。

　　“你缠着人家妇女干吗？用得着你查什么票？”

　　旁边的铺位上耷拉下来八条腿。这些耷拉着腿的人勾肩搭背地坐在上面，起劲地嗑着葵花子。这些人显然是一帮合伙倒腾粮食的投机商，走南闯北，常在铁路上来往。现在保尔没有工夫理睬他们，先把丽达接上车来要紧。

　　“这是谁的？”他指着车窗旁边的小木头箱子，问一个上了年纪的铁路工人。

　　“是那个女人的。”老工人指了指两条穿褐色长筒袜的粗腿说。

　　应该打开车窗，可是箱子碍事，又没有地方放。于是保尔把箱子抱起来，交给了它的主人。

　　“请您先拿一下，公民，我要开窗子。”

　　“你怎么乱动别人的东西！”保尔刚把箱子放到坐在上铺的塌鼻子女人的膝盖上，她就尖声叫了起来。

　　“莫季卡，你看这个人在这儿胡闹什么呀？”她又转过脸来，向身旁的人求援。那个人没有动地方，用凉鞋对保尔背上踢了一脚，说：“喂，你这个癞皮狗！快给我滚蛋，要不我就揍死你。”

　　保尔背上挨了这一脚，忍着没有做声。他咬紧嘴唇，打开了车窗。

　　“同志，请您稍微让开一点。”他向那个铁路工人请求说。

　　保尔把一只铁桶挪开，腾出个地方来，站到车窗跟前。丽达早就在车厢旁边等候，就连忙把旅行袋递给他。保尔把旅行袋往那个夹着铁桶的胖女人膝盖上一扔，探出身子，抓住丽达的两只手，把她拉了上来。一个值勤的红军战士发现了这一违章行为，刚要过来制止，丽达已经爬进了车厢。那个动作迟缓的战士没有办法，只好骂了几句，走开了。丽达一进车厢，那伙投机商都吵嚷起来，弄得她很难为情，不知道怎么办好。她连落脚的地方都没有，只好抓住上铺的把手，站在下铺的边缘上。周围是一片辱骂声。上铺那个粗嗓门骂道：“瞧这个混蛋，自己爬进来不算，还弄进来一个婊子！”

　　从上面看不见的地方，有个尖嗓子叫道：“莫季卡，照准他鼻梁子使劲揍！”

　　塌鼻子女人也乘机要把木箱子放到保尔的头上。周围全是充满敌意的不三不四的人。保尔很后悔，不该领丽达到这里来。但是，总得想办法给她找个座位。于是，他向那个叫莫季卡的说：“公民，把你的口袋从过道上挪开，这位同志连站的地方都没有。”但是，那个家伙不但没有动弹，反而骂了一句非常下流的话，气得保尔火冒三丈。他右眉上边的伤疤像针扎一样剧烈地疼起来。他压住怒火，对那个流氓说：“下流坯子，你等着，回头我跟你算帐！”就在这个时候，上面又有人在他头上踢了一脚。

　　“瓦西卡，再给他点厉害瞧瞧！”周围的人像嗾狗似的喊叫起来。

　　保尔憋了好久的怒火，再也按捺不住，终于爆发了。他总是这样，一发起火来，动作就异常迅猛。

　　“怎么，你们这帮坏蛋、奸商，竟敢欺负人？”保尔像蹬着弹簧，两手一撑就蹿到中铺上，挥起拳头，朝莫季卡那副蛮横无耻的脸上猛力打去。这一拳真有劲，那个家伙一下子就栽下去。跌落在过道里的人们的头上。

　　“你们这帮混蛋，统统给我滚下去。不然的话，我就要你们的狗命！”保尔用手枪指着上铺那四个人的鼻子，怒冲冲地吼着。

　　这样一来，局面完全改变了。丽达密切注视着周围所有的人，要是有谁敢碰碰保尔，她就准备开枪。上铺马上腾出来了，那个贼眉鼠眼的家伙也慌忙躲到隔壁的铺位上去。

　　保尔把丽达安置在空出来的位子上，低声对她说：“你在这儿坐着，我跟他们算帐去。”

　　丽达拦住他说：“你还要去打架？”

　　“不打架，我马上就回来。”他安慰她说。

　　保尔又把车窗打开，跳到站台上。几分钟之后，他跨进铁路肃反委员会，走到他的老首长布尔梅斯捷尔的办公桌前。

　　布尔梅斯捷尔是拉脱维亚人，听保尔谈完情况后，下令让四号车厢的全体旅客下车，检查证件。

　　“我早说过，哪次都是火车还没进站，投机商就上了车。”

　　布尔梅斯捷尔咕哝着。

　　由十名肃反人员组成的检查组，对车厢进行了一次彻底的大检查。保尔按照老习惯，帮着检查了整个列车。他离开肃反委员会之后，仍然同那里的朋友们保持着联系，而且在他担任共青团书记之后，向铁路肃反委员会输送了不少优秀团员。检查完毕，保尔又回到丽达的车厢。这时，车里已经上满了新的乘客，他们都是出差的干部和红军战士。

　　其他地方已经堆满了一捆捆的报纸，只在车厢顶头的三号上铺给丽达找到了一个位子。

　　“行了，咱们凑合着坐吧。”丽达说。

　　火车开动了。车窗外面那个胖女人高高地坐在一大堆口袋上，向后退去。只听她喊道：“曼卡，我的油桶呢？”

　　丽达和保尔挤在一个小铺位上，跟邻铺之间隔着一捆捆的报纸。他俩一边兴致勃勃地谈论刚才这个令人不大愉快的插曲，一边狼吞虎咽地嚼着面包和苹果。

　　火车缓慢地爬行着。车辆失于检修，又载重过多，不断发出吱吱嘎嘎的响声，每到接轨的地方就震动一下。傍晚，车厢里渐渐暗下来，不一会儿夜幕便遮住了敞开的车窗，车厢里一片漆黑。

　　丽达非常疲乏，把头枕在旅行袋上打起盹来。保尔耷拉着两条腿，坐在铺边上抽烟。他也很累，但是没有地方可以躺下。凉爽的夜风，从车窗吹进来。车身突然一震，丽达惊醒了。她看见保尔的烟头在发光。“他会一直这样坐到天亮的，看样子，他是不愿意挤我，怕我难为情。”

　　“柯察金同志！请阁下把资产阶级那套繁文缛节扔掉吧，来，躺下休息休息。”她开玩笑说。

　　保尔在她身边躺了下来，非常舒服地伸直了两条发麻的腿。

　　“明天咱们还有很多工作要做，睡吧，你这个爱打架的家伙。”她坦然地用胳膊抱住她的朋友，保尔感到她的头发挨着了他的脸。

　　在保尔的心目中，丽达是神圣不可侵犯的。他们为同一目标而奋斗，她是他的战友和同志，是他政治上的指导者。不过，她毕竟是一个女人。这一点，他是今天在天桥上第一次意识到的，所以，她的拥抱使他心情很激动。他感觉到她那均匀的呼吸，她的嘴唇就在很近的地方。这使他产生了要找到那嘴唇的强烈愿望，不过他还是用顽强的毅力，把这种愿望克制住了。

　　丽达似乎猜到了保尔的感情，在暗中微笑了。她已经尝过爱情的欢乐和失掉爱情的痛苦。她先后把她的爱情献给两个布尔什维克，可是，白卫军的子弹却把那两个人从她手中夺走了：一个是英勇的、身材魁梧的旅长，另一个是生着一对明亮的蓝眼睛的青年。

　　车轮有节奏的响声很快就使保尔入睡了。直到第二天早晨，汽笛的吼声才把他吵醒。

　　最近，丽达都是很晚才回到自己的房间。她那本笔记本不常打开，写的几则日记，也都很简短。

　　８月１１日

　　省代表会议结束了。阿基姆、米海拉和其他一些同志都到哈尔科夫参加全乌克兰代表会议去了。日常事务工作全部落到了我的身上。杜巴瓦和保尔都收到了列席团省委会议的证件。杜巴瓦从到佩乔拉区担任团委书记以后，晚上就不再来学习了。他工作很忙。保尔还想继续学习，不过有时候我没有工夫，有时候他又到外地出差。由于铁路上的情况日益紧张，他们那里经常处于动员状态。昨天，扎尔基到我这里来，他很不满意我们从他那里调走一些人。他说，这些人他也非常需要。

　　８月２３日

　　今天我从走廊走过时，看见潘克拉托夫、柯察金，还有一个不认识的人站在行政处门口。我往前走，听见保尔正在讲着什么事：“那边的几个家伙，枪毙了也不可惜。他们说什么‘你们无权干涉我们的事务。这里的事自有铁路林业委员会作主，用不着什么共青团来管。’瞧他们那副嘴脸……这帮寄生虫可找到了藏身的地方！……”

　　接着就是一句不堪入耳的骂人话。潘克拉托夫一看见我，捅了保尔一下。他回过头来，看见是我，脸都白了。他没敢再看我，连忙走开了。这回他大概会有很长时间不到我这里来，因为他知道，对于骂人，我是不能原谅的。

　　８月２７日

　　今天常委会开了一次内部会谈。情况越来越复杂。现在我还不能把全部情况都记下来——不允许。阿基姆从县里回来了，心情挺不好。昨天在捷捷列夫站附近，运粮专车又被人弄出了轨。看来，我得索性不写日记了，反正总是那么零零碎碎的。我正等

Part Two Chapter 2
---

Fyodor took his short-stemmed pipe out of his mouth and poked reflectively at the ash in the bowl with a cautious finger; the pipe was out. 

A dense cloud of grey smoke from a dozen cigarettes hovered below the ceiling and over the chair where sat the Chairman of the Gubernia Executive Committee. From the corners of the room the faces of the people seated around the table were only dimly visible through the haze. 

Tokarev, sitting next to the Chairman, leaned forward and plucked irritably at his sparse beard, glancing now and again out of the corner of his eye at a short, bald-headed man whose high-pitched voice went on endlessly stringing out phrases that were as empty and meaningless as a sucked egg. 

Akim caught the look in the old worker's eye and was reminded of a fighting cock back in his childhood days in the village who had had the same wicked look in his eye just before pouncing on his adversary. 

The Gubernia Party Committee had been in conference for more than an hour. The bald man was Chairman of the Railway Firewood Committee. 

Leafing with nimble fingers through the heap of papers before him, the bald man rattled on: ".. 

.Under these circumstances it is clearly impossible to carry out the decision of the Gubernia Committee and the railway management. I repeat, even a month from now we shall not be able to give more than four hundred cubic metres of firewood. As for the one hundred and eighty thousand cubic metres required, well, that's sheer..." the speaker fumbled for the right word, "er... sheer utopia!" he wound up and his small mouth pursed itself up into an expression of injury. There was a long silence. 

Fyodor tapped his pipe with his fingernail and knocked out the ashes. It was Tokarev who finally broke the silence. 

"There's no use wasting our breath," he began in his rumbling bass. "The Railway Firewood Committee hasn't any firewood, never had any, and doesn't expect any in the future.... Right?" 

The bald man shrugged a shoulder. 

"Excuse me, Comrade, we did stock up firewood, but the shortage of road transport...." He swallowed, wiped his polished pate with a checkered handkerchief; he made several fruitless attempts to stuff the handkerchief back into his pocket, and finally shoved it nervously under his portfolio. 

"What have you done about delivering the wood? After all, a good many days have passed since the leading specialists mixed up in the conspiracy were arrested," Denekko observed from his corner. 

The bald man turned to him. "I wrote the railway administration three times stating that unless we had the proper transport facilities it would be impossible...." 

Tokarev stopped him. "We've heard that already," he said coldly, eyeing the bald man with hostility. "Do you take us for a pack of fools?" 

The bald man felt a chill run down his spine at these words. 

"I cannot answer for the actions of counter-revolutionaries," he replied in a low voice. 

"But you knew, didn't you, that the timber was being felled a long distance from the railway line?" 

"I heard about it, but I could not bring the attention of my superiors to irregularities on a sector outside my province." 

"How many men have you on the job?" the chairman of the trade union council demanded. 

"About two hundred," the bald man replied. 

"That makes a cubic metre a year for every parasite!" fumed Tokarev. 

"The Railway Firewood Committee has been allotted special rations, food the workers ought to be getting, and look what you're doing? What happened to those two carriages of flour you received for the workers?" the trade union chairman persisted. 

Similar pointed questions rained down on the bald man from all sides and he answered them in the harassed manner of a man trying to ward off annoying creditors. He twisted and turned like an eel to avoid direct answers, but his eyes darted nervously about him. He sensed danger and his cowardly soul craved but one thing: to get away from here as quickly as possible and slink off to his cosy nest, to his supper and his still youthful wife who was probably cosily whiling away the time with a Paul de Kock novel. 

Lending an attentive ear to the bald man's replies, Fyodor scribbled in his notebook: "I believe this man ought to be checked up on properly. This is more than mere incompetence. I know one or two things about him.... Stop the discussion and let him go so we can get down to business." 

The Chairman read the note and nodded to Fyodor. 

Zhukhrai rose and went out into the corridor to make a telephone call. When he returned the Chairman was reading the resolution: 

". . .to remove the management of the Railway Firewood Committee for downright sabotage, the matter of the timber workings to be turned over to the investigation authorities." 

The bald man had expected worse. True, to be removed from his post for downright sabotage would raise the question of his reliability in general, but that was a mere trifle. As for the Boyarka business, he was not worried, that was not his province after all. "A close shave, though," he said to himself, "I thought they had really dug up something. ..." 

Now almost reassured, he remarked as he put his papers back into his portfolio: "Of course, I am a non-Party specialist and you are at liberty to distrust me. But my conscience is clear. If I have failed to do what was required of me that was because it was impossible." 

No one made any comment. The bald man went out, hurried downstairs, and opened the street door with a feeling of intense relief. 

"Your name, please?" a man in an army coat accosted him. 

With a sinking heart the baldhead stammered: "Cher. . . vinsky...." 

Upstairs as soon as the outsider was gone, thirteen heads bent closer over the large conference table. 

"See here," Zhukhrai's finger jabbed the unfolded map. "That's Boyarka station. The timber felling is six versts away. There are two hundred and ten thousand cubic metres of wood stacked up at this point: a whole army of men worked hard for eight months to pile up all that wood, and what's the result? Treachery. The railway and the town are without firewood. To haul that timber six versts to the station would take five thousand carts no less than one month, and that only if they made two trips a day. The nearest village is fifteen versts away. What's more, Orlik and his band are prowling about in those parts. You realise what this means? Look, according to the plan the felling was to have been started right here and continued in the direction of the station, and those scoundrels carried it right into the depths of the forest. The purpose was to make sure we would not be able to haul the firewood to the railway line. And they weren't far wrong — we can't even get a hundred carts for the job. It's a foul blow they've struck us. The uprising was no more serious than this." 

Zhukhrai's clenched fist dropped heavily onto the waxed paper of the map. Each of the thirteen clearly visualised the grimmer aspects of the situation which Zhukhrai had omitted to mention. 

Winter was in the offing. They saw hospitals, schools, offices and hundreds of thousands of people caught in the icy grip of the frost; the railway stations swarming with people and only one train a week to handle the traffic. 

There was deep silence as each man pondered the situation. 

At length Fyodor relaxed his fist. 

"There is one way out, Comrades," he said. 

"We must build a seven-verst narrow-gauge line from the station to the timber tract in three months. The first section leading to the beginning of the tract must be ready in six weeks. I've been working on this for the past week. We'll need," Zhukhrai's voice cracked in his dry throat, "three hundred and fifty workers and two engineers. There is enough rails and seven engines at Pushcha-Voditsa. The Komsomols dug them up in the warehouses. There was a project to lay a narrow-gauge line from Pushcha-Voditsa to the town before the war. The trouble is there are no accommodations in Boyarka for the workers, the place is in ruins. We'll have to send the men in small groups for a fortnight at a time, they won't be able to hold out any longer than that. Shall we send the Komsomols, Akim?" And without waiting for an answer, he went on: "The Komsomol will rush as many of its members to the spot as possible. There's the Solomenka organisation to begin with, and some from the town. The-task is hard, very hard, but if the youngsters are told what is at stake I'm certain they'll do it."

The chief of the railway shook his head dubiously.

"I'm afraid it's no use. To lay seven versts of track in the woods under such conditions, with the autumn rains due and the frosts coming..." he began wearily. But Zhukhrai cut him short. "You ought to have paid more attention to the firewood problem, Andrei Vasilievich. That line has got to be built and we're going to build it.

We're not going to fold our hands and freeze to death,are we?"

The last crates of tools were loaded onto the train. The train crew took their places. A fine drizzle was falling. Crystal raindrops rolled down Rita's glistening leather jacket.

Rita shook hands warmly with Tokarev. "We wish you luck," she said softly.

The old man regarded her affectionately from beneath his bushy grey eyebrows.

"Yes, they've given us a peck of trouble, blast 'em," he growled in answer to his own thoughts.

"You here had better look to things, so that if there's any hitch over there you can put a bit of pressure on where it's needed. These good-for-nothings here can't do anything without a lot of red tape. Well, time I was getting aboard, daughter."

The old man buttoned up his jacket. At the last moment Rita inquired casually: "Isn't Korchagin going along? I didn't notice him among the boys."

"No, he and the job superintendent went out there yesterday by handcar to prepare for our coming."

At that moment Zharky, Dubava, and Anna Borhart with her jacket thrown carelessly across her shoulders and a cigarette between her slender fingers, came hurrying down the platform toward them.

Rita had time to ask Tokarev one more question before the others joined them.

"How are your studies with Korchagin getting along?"

The old man looked at her in surprise.

"What studies? The lad's under your wing, isn't he? He's told me a lot about you. Thinks the world of you."

Rita looked sceptical. "Are you quite sure, Comrade Tokarev? Didn't he always go to you for a proper explanation after his lessons with me?"

The old man burst out laughing. "To me? Why, I never saw hide or hair of him."

The engine shrieked. Klavicek shouted from one of the carriages:

"Hey, Comrade Ustinovich, give us our daddy back! What'd we do without him?"

The Czech was about to say something else, but catching sight of the three late-comers he checked himself. He noticed the anxious look in Anna's eyes, caught with a pang her parting smile to Dubava and turned quickly away from the window.

The autumn rain lashed the face. Low clouds, leaden-hued and swollen with moisture, crawled over the earth. Late autumn had stripped the woods bare; and the old hornbeams looked gaunt and downcast, their wrinkled trunks hidden under the brown moss. Remorseless autumn had robbed them of their luxuriant garments, and they stood there naked and pitiful. 

The little station building huddled forlornly in the midst of the forest. A strip of freshly dug earth ran from the stone freight platform into the woods. Around this strip men swarmed like ants. 

The clayey mud squelched unpleasantly underfoot. There was a ringing of crowbars and a grating of spades on stone over by the embankment where the men were furiously digging. 

The rain came down as if through a fine sieve and the chill drops penetrated the men's clothing. 

The rain threatened to wash away what their labour had accomplished, for the clay slid down the embankment in a soggy mass. 

Soaked to the skin, their clothing chill and sodden, the men worked on until long after dark. 

And with every day the strip of upturned earth penetrated farther and farther into the forest. 

Not far from the station loomed the grim skeleton of what had once been a brick building. 

Everything that could be removed bodily, torn out or blasted loose had long since been carried off by marauders. There were gaping holes in place of windows and doors; black gashes where stove doors had once been. Through the holes in the tattered roof the rafters showed like the ribs of a skeleton. 

Only the concrete floor in the four large rooms remained intact. At night four hundred men slept on this floor in their damp, mud-caked clothing. Muddy water streamed from their clothes when they wrung them out at the doorway. And the men heaped bitter curses on the rain and the boggy soil. They lay in compact rows on the concrete floor with its thin covering of straw, huddling together for warmth. The steam rose from their clothing but it did not dry. And the rain seeped through the sacks that were nailed over the empty window frames and trickled down onto the floor. It drummed loudly on the remnants of sheet metal roofing, and the wind whistled through the great cracks in the door. In the morning they drank tea in the tumbledown barracks that served for a kitchen, and went off to their work. Dinner, day after day with sickening monotony, consisted of plain boiled lentils, and there was a daily allowance of a pound and a half of bread as black as coal. 

That was all the town could provide. The job superintendent, Valerian Nikodimovich Patoshkin, a tall spare old man with two deep lines at his mouth, and technician Vakulenko, a thickset man with a coarse-featured face and a fleshy nose, had put up at the station master's house. 

Tokarev shared the tiny room occupied by the station Cheka agent, a small, volatile man named Kholyava. 

The men endured the hardships with dogged fortitude, and the railway embankment reached farther into the forest from day to day. 

True, there had been some desertions: at first nine, and a few days later, another five. 

The first major calamity occurred a week after the work started, when the bread supply failed to arrive with the night train.

Dubava woke Tokarev and told him the news. The secretary of the Party group swung his hairy legs over the side of the bed and scratched himself furiously under the armpit. 

"The fun's beginning!" he growled and began hastily to dress. 

Kholyava waddled in on his short legs. 

"Run down to the telephone and call the Special Department," Tokarev instructed him, and turning to Dubava added, "and not a word to anybody about the bread, mind." 

After berating the railway telephone operators for a full half hour, the irrepressible Kholyava succeeded in getting Zhukhrai, the assistant chief of the Special Department, on the line, while Tokarev stood by fidgeting with impatience. 

"What! Bread not delivered? I'll find out who's responsible for that!" Zhukhrai's voice coming over the wire had an ominous ring. 

"What are we going to give the men to eat tomorrow?" Tokarev shouted back angrily. 

There was a long pause; Zhukhrai was evidently considering some plan of action. "You'll get the bread tonight," he said at last. "I'll send young Litke with the car. He knows the way. You'll have the bread by morning." 

At dawn a mud-spattered car loaded with sacks of bread drove up to the station. Litke, his face white and strained after a sleepless night at the wheel, climbed out wearily. 

Work on the railway line became a struggle against increasing odds. The railway administration announced that there were no sleepers to be had. The town authorities could find no means of shipping the rails and engines to the railway job, and the engines themselves turned out to be in need of substantial repairs. No workers were forthcoming to replace the first batch who had done their share and were now so completely worn out that there could be no question of detaining them. 

The leading Party members met in the tumbledown shed dimly lit by a wick lamp and sat up late into the night discussing the situation. 

The following morning Tokarev, Dubava and Klavicek went to town, taking six men with them to repair the engines and speed up the shipment of the rails. Klavicek, who was a baker by trade, was sent as inspector to the supply department, while the rest went on to Pushcha-Voditsa. 

The rain poured down without ceasing.

Pavel Korchagin pulled his foot out of the sticky slime with an effort. A sharp sensation of cold told him that the worn sole of his boot had finally parted from the uppers. His torn boots had been a source of keen discomfort to Pavel ever since he had come to the job. They were never dry and the mud that filtered in squelched when he walked. Now one sole was gone altogether and the icy mire cut into his bare foot. Pavel pulled the sole out of the mud and regarded it with despair and broke the vow he had given himself not to swear. He could not go on working with one foot exposed, so he hobbled back to the barracks, sat down beside the field kitchen, took off his muddy footcloth and stretched out his numb foot to the fire. 

Odarka, the lineman's wife who worked as cook's helper, was busy cutting up beetroots at the kitchen table. A woman of generous proportions, still youthful, with broad almost masculine shoulders, an ample bosom and massive hips, she wielded the kitchen knife with vigour and the mountain of sliced vegetables grew rapidly under her nimble fingers.

Odarka threw a careless glance at Pavel and snapped at him:

"If it's dinner you're hankering after you're a bit early, my lad. Ought to be ashamed of yourself sneaking away from work like that! Take your feet off that stove.

This is a kitchen, not a bathhouse!"

The cook came in at that point.

"My blasted boot has gone to pieces," Pavel said, explaining his untimely presence in the kitchen.

The elderly cook looked at the battered boot and nodding toward Odarka he said: "Her husband might be able to do something with it, he's a bit of a cobbler. Better see to it or you'll be in a bad way. You can't get along without boots."

When she heard this, Odarka took another look at Pavel.

"I took you for a loafer," she admitted.

Pavel smiled to show that there were no hard feelings. Odarka examined the boot with the eye of an expert.

"There's no use trying to patch it," she concluded.

"But I'll tell you what I can do. I'll bring you an old galosh we've got lying around at home and you can wear it on top of the boot. You can't go around like that, you'll kill yourself! The frosts will start any day now!"

And Odarka, now all sympathy, laid down her knife and hurried out, returning shortly with a deep galosh and a strip of stout linen.

As he wrapped his foot, now warm and dry, in the thick linen and put it into the galosh, Pavel rewarded Odarka with a grateful look.

Tokarev came back from town fuming. He called a meeting of the leading Communists in Kholyava's room and told them the unpleasant news.

"Nothing but obstacles all along the line. Wherever you go the wheels seem to be turning but they don't get anywhere. Far too many of those White rats about, and it looks as if there'll be enough to last our lifetime anyway. I tell you, boys, things look bad. There are no replacements for us yet and no one knows how many there will be. The frosts are due any day now, and we must get through the marsh before then at all costs, because when the ground freezes it'll be too late. So while they're shaking up those fellows in town who're making a mess of things, we here have to double our speed. That line has got to be built and we're going to build it if we die doing it.

Otherwise it isn't Bolsheviks we'll be but jelly-fish." There was a steely note in Tokarev's hoarse bass voice, and his eyes under their bushy brows had a stubborn gleam.

"We'll call a closed meeting today and pass on the news to our Party members and tomorrow we'll all get down to work. In the morning we'll let the non-Party fellows go; the rest of us will stay.

Here's the Gubernia Committee decision," he said, handing Pankratov a folded sheet of paper.

Pavel Korchagin, peering over Pankratov's shoulder, read: "In view of the emergency all members of the Komsomol are to remain on the job and are not to be relieved until the first consignment of firewood is forthcoming. Signed R. Ustinovich, on behalf of the Secretary of the Gubernia Committee."

The kitchen barracks was packed. One hundred and twenty men had squeezed themselves into its narrow confines. They stood against the walls, climbed on the tables and some were even perched on top of the field kitchen.

Pankratov opened the meeting. Then Tokarev made a brief speech winding up with an announcement that had the effect of a bombshell:

"The Communists and Komsomols will not leave the job tomorrow."

The old man accompanied his statement with a gesture that stressed the finality of the "decision. It swept away all cherished hopes of returning to town, going home, getting away from this hole.

A roar of angry voices drowned out everything else for a few moments. The swaying bodies caused the feeble oil light to flicker fitfully. In the semidarkness the commotion increased. They wanted to go "home"; they protested indignantly that they had had as much as they could stand.

Some received the news in silence. And only one man spoke of deserting.

"To hell with it all!" he shouted angrily from his corner, loosing an ugly stream of invective. "I'm not going to stay here another day. It's all right to do hardlabour if you've committed a crime. But what have we done? We're fools to stand for it. We've had two weeks of it, and that's enough. Let those who made the decision come out and do the work themselves. Maybe some folks like poking around in this muck, but I've only one life to live. I'm leaving tomorrow."

The voice came from behind Okunev and he lit a match to see who it was. For an instant the speaker's rage-distorted face and open mouth were snatched out of the darkness by the match's flame. But that instant was enough for Okunev to recognise the son of a gubernia food commissariat bookkeeper.

"Checking up, eh?" he snarled. "Well, I'm not afraid, I'm no thief."

The match flickered out. Pankratov rose and drew himself up to his full height.

"What kind of talk is that? Who dares to compare a Party task to a hard-labour sentence?" he thundered, running his eyes menacingly over the front rows. "No, Comrades, there's no going to town for us, our place is here. If we clear out now folks will freeze to death. The sooner we finish the job the sooner we get back home. Running away like that whiner back there suggests doesn't fit in with our ideas or our discipline."

Pankratov, a stevedore, was not fond of long speeches but even this brief statement was interrupted by the same irate voice.

"The non-Party fellows are leaving, aren't they?"

"Yes."

A lad in a short overcoat came elbowing his way to the front. A Komsomol card flew up, struck against Pankratov's chest, dropped onto the table and stood on edge.

"There, take your card. I'm not going to risk my health for a bit of cardboard!"

His last words were drowned out by a roar of angry voices:

"What do you think you're throwing around!"

"Treacherous bastard!"

"Got into the Komsomol because he thought he'd have it easy."

"Chuck him out!"

"Let me get at the louse!"

The deserter, his head lowered, made his way to the exit. They let him pass, shrinking away from him as from a leper. The door closed with a creak behind him.

Pankratov picked up the discarded membership card and held it to the flame of the oil lamp.

The cardboard caught alight and curled up as it burned.

A shot echoed in the forest. A horseman turned from the tumbledown barracks and dived into the darkness of the forest. A moment later men came pouring out of the barracks and school building. 

Someone discovered a piece of plywood that had been stuck into the door. A match flared up and shielding the unsteady flame from the wind they read the scrawled message: "Clear out of here and go back where you came from. If you don't, we will shoot every one of you. I give you till tomorrow night to get out. Ataman Chesnok." 

Chesnok belonged to Orlik's band.

An open diary lies on the table in Rita's room.

December 2

"We had our first snow this morning. The frost is severe. I met Vyacheslav Olshinsky on the stairs and we walked down the street together. 

" 'I always enjoy the first snowfall,' he said. 'Particularly when it is frosty like this. Lovely, isn't it?' 

"But I was thinking of Boyarka and I told him that the frost and snow do not gladden me at all. On the contrary they depress me. And I told him why. 

" 'That is a purely subjective reaction,' he said. 'If one argues on that premise all merriment or any manifestation of joy in wartime, for example, would have to be banned. But life is not like that. 

The tragedy is confined to the strip of front line where the battle is being fought. There life is overshadowed by the proximity of death. Yet even there people laugh.

And away from the front, life goes on as always: people laugh, weep, suffer, rejoice, love, seek amusement, entertainment, excitement.' 

"It was difficult to detect any shade of irony in Olshinsky's words. Olshinsky is a representative of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. He has been in the Party since 1917. He dresses well, is always cleanly shaven with a faint scent of perfume about him. He lives in our house, in Segal's apartment. Sometimes he drops in to see me in the evenings. He is very interesting to talk to, he knows a lot about Europe, lived for many years in Paris. But I doubt whether he and I could 

ever be good friends. That is because for him I am primarily a woman; the fact that I am his Party comrade is a secondary consideration. True, he does not attempt to disguise his sentiments and opinions on this score, he has the courage of his convictions and there is nothing coarse about his attentions. He has the knack of investing them with a sort of beauty. Yet I do not like him. 

"The gruff simplicity of Zhukhrai is far more to my taste than all Olshinsky's polished European manners. 

"News from Boyarka comes in the form of brief reports. Each day another two hundred yards laid. 

They are laying the sleepers straight on the frozen earth, hewing out shallow beds for them. There are only two hundred and forty men on the job. Half of the replacements deserted. The conditions there are truly frightful. I can't imagine how they will be able to carry on in the frost. Dubava has been gone a week now. They were only able to repair five of the eight engines at Pushcha-Voditsa, there were not enough parts for the others. 

"Dmitri has had criminal charges laid against him by the tramcar authorities. He and his brigade held up all the flatcars belonging to the tram system running to town from Pushcha-Voditsa, cleared off the passengers and loaded the cars with rails for the Boyarka line. They brought 19 carloads of rails along the tram tracks to the railway station in town. The tram crews were only too glad to help. 

"The Solomenka Komsomols still in town worked all night loading the rails onto railway cars and Dmitri and his brigade went off with them to Boyarka. 

"Akim refused to have Dubava's action taken up at the Komsomol Bureau. Dmitri has told us about the outrageous bureaucracy and red tape in the tramcar administration.

They flatly refused to give more than two cars for the job. 

"Tufta, however, privately reprimanded Dubava. 'It's time to drop these partisan tactics,' he said, 'or you'll find yourself in jail before you know it. Surely you could have come to some agreement without resorting to force of arms?' 

"I had never seen Dubava so furious. 

" 'Why didn't you try talking to them yourself, you rotten pen-pusher?' he stormed. 'All you can do is sit here warming your chair and wagging your tongue. How do you think I could go back to Boyarka without those rails? Instead of hanging around here and getting in everybody's hair you ought to be sent out there to do some useful work. Tokarev would knock some sense into you!' 

Dmitri roared so loudly he could be heard all over the building. 

"Tufta wrote a complaint against Dubava, but Akim asked me to leave the room and talked to him alone for about ten minutes, after which Tufta stamped out red and fuming."

December 3

"The Gubernia Committee has received another complaint, this time from the Transport Cheka. It appears that Pankratov, Okunev and several other comrades went to Motovilovka station and removed all the doors and window frames from the empty buildings. When they were loading all this onto a freight train the station Cheka man tried to arrest them. They disarmed him, emptied his revolver and returned it to him only after the train was in motion. They got away with the doors and window frames. 

"Tokarev is charged by the supply department of the railway for taking twenty poods of nails from the Boyarka railway stocks. He gave the nails to the peasants in payment for their help in hauling the timber they are using for sleepers. 

"I spoke to Comrade Zhukhrai about all these complaints. But he only laughed. 'We'll take care of all that,' he said. 

"The situation at the railway job is very tense and now every day is precious. We have to bring pressure to bear here for every trifle. Every now and then we have to summon hinderers to the Gubernia Committee. And over at the job the boys are overriding all formalities more and more often. 

"Olshinsky has brought me a little electric stove. Olga Yureneva and I warm our hands over it, but it doesn't make the room any warmer. I wonder how those men in the woods are faring this bitter cold night? Olga tells me that it is so cold in the hospital that the patients shiver under their blankets. The place is heated only once in two days.

"No, Comrade Olshinsky, a tragedy at the front is a tragedy in the rear too!"

December 4

"It snowed all night. From Boyarka they write that everything is snowbound and they have had to stop working to clear the track. Today the Gubernia Committee passed a decision that the first section of the railway, up to where the wood was being cut, is to be ready not later than January 1,1922. When this decision reached Boyarka, Tokarev is said to have remarked: 'We'll do it, if we don't croak by then.'

"I hear nothing at all about Korchagin. I'm rather surprised that he hasn't been mixed up in something like the Pankratov 'case'. I still don't understand why he avoids me."

December 5

"Yesterday there was a bandit raid on the railway job."

The horses trod warily in the soft, yielding snow. Now and then a twig hidden under the snow would snap under a hoof and the horse would snort and shy, but a sharp rap over its laid-back ears would send it galloping after the others.

Some dozen horsemen crossed the hilly ridge beyond which lay a strip of dark earth not yet blanketed with snow. Here the riders reined in their horses. There was a faint clink as stirrup met stirrup. The leader's stallion, its coat glossy with sweat after the long run, shook itself noisily.

"There's a hell of a lot of them here," said the head rider in Ukrainian. "But we'll soon put the fear of God into 'em. The ataman said the bastards were to be chased out of here by tomorrow. They're getting too damned close to the firewood."

They rode up to the station single file, hugging the sides of the narrow-gauge line. In sight of the clearing near the old school building they slowed down to a walking pace and came to a halt behind the trees, not venturing out into the open.

A volley rent the silence of the night. A layer of snow dropped squirrel-like off the branch of a birch that gleamed like silver in the light of the moon. Gunfire flashed among the trees, bullets bored into crumbling plaster and there was a tinkling of broken glass as Pan-kratov's window panes were smashed to smithereens.

The men on the concrete floor leapt up at the shooting only to drop back again on top of one another when the lethal insects began to fly about the room.

"Where you going?" Dubava seized Pavel by the coat tail.

"Outside."

"Get down, you idiot!" Dmitri hissed. "They'll get you the moment you stick your head out."

They lay side by side next to the door. Dubava was flattened against the floor, with his revolver pointing toward the door. Pavel sat on his haunches nervously fingering the drum of his revolver.

There were five rounds in it — one chamber was empty. He turned the cylinder another notch.

The shooting ceased suddenly. The silence that followed was weighted with tension.

"All those who have weapons come this way," Dubava commanded in a hoarse whisper.

Pavel opened the door cautiously. The clearing was deserted. Snowflakes were falling softly.

In the forest ten horsemen were whipping their mounts into a gallop.

The next day a trolley arrived from town. Zhukhrai and Akim alighted and were met by Tokarev and Kholyava. A machine-gun, several crates of cartridge belts and two dozen rifles were unloaded onto the platform.

They hurried over to the railway line. The tails of Fyodor's long greatcoat trailed a zigzag pattern in the snow behind him. He still walked with the clumsy rolling gait of the seaman, as if he were pacing the pitching deck of a destroyer. Long-legged Akim walked in step with Fyodor, but Tokarev had to break into a trot now and again to keep up with them.

"The bandit raid is not our worst trouble. There's a nasty rise in the ground right in the path of the line. Just our bad luck. It'll mean a lot of extra digging."

The old man stopped, turned his back to the wind and lit a cigarette, cupping his hand over the match. After blowing out a few puffs of smoke he hurried to catch up with the others. Akim had stopped to wait for him, but Zhukhrai strode on ahead.

"Do you think you'll be able to finish the line on time?" Akim asked Tokarev.

Tokarev paused a while before replying.

"Well, it's like this, son," he said at last. "Generally speaking it can't be done. But it's got to be done, so there you are."

They caught up with Fyodor and continued abreast.

"Here's how it is," Tokarev began earnestly. "Only two of us here, Patoshkin and I, know that it's impossible to build a line under these conditions, with the scanty equipment and labour power we have. But all the others, every last man of them, know that the line has got to be built at all costs.

So you see that's why I said if we don't freeze to death, it'll be done. Judge for yourselves: we've been digging here for over a month, the fourth batch of

replacements are due for a rest, but the main body of workers have been on the job all the time. It's only their youth that keeps them going. But half of them are badly chilled. Makes your heart bleed to look at them. These lads are worth their weight in gold. But this cursed hole will be the death of more than one of them."

The ready narrow-gauge track came to an end a kilometre from the station. Beyond that, for a stretch of about one and a half kilometres, the levelled roadbed was covered by what looked like a log palisade blown down by wind — these were the sleepers, all firmly planted in place. And beyond them, all the way to the rise, there was only a level road.

Pankratov's building crew No. 1 was working at this section. Forty men were laying ties, while a carroty-bearded peasant wearing a new pair of bast shoes was unhurriedly emptying a load of logs on the roadbed. Several more sleds were being unloaded a little farther away. Two long iron bars lay on the ground — these were used to level up the sleepers properly. Axes, crowbars and shovels were all used to tamp down the ballast.

Laying railway sleepers is slow, laborious work. The sleepers must be firmly imbedded in the earth so that the rails press evenly on each of them. 

Only one man in the group knew the technique of laying sleepers. That was Talya's father, the line foreman Lagutin, a man of 54 with a pitch-black beard parted in the middle and not a grey hair in his head. He had worked at Boyarka since the beginning of the job, sharing all the hardships with the younger men and had earned the respect of the whole detachment. Although he was not a Party member, Lagutin invariably held a place of honour at all Party conferences. He was very proud of this and had given his word not to leave until the job was finished. 

"How can I leave you to carry on by yourselves? Something's bound to go wrong without an experienced man to keep an eye on things. When it comes to that, I've hammered in more of these here sleepers up and down the country in my time than I can remember," he would say goodhumouredly each time the question of replacements came up. And so he stayed. 

Patoshkin saw that Lagutin knew his job and rarely inspected his sector. When Tokarev with Akim and Zhukhrai came over to where they were working, Pankratov, flushed and perspiring with exertion, was hewing out a hollow for a sleeper. Akim hardly recognised the young stevedore. Pankratov had lost much weight, his broad cheekbones protruded sharply in his grimy face which was sallow and sunken. 

"Well, well," he said as he gave Akim a hot, damp hand, "the big chiefs have come!" 

The ringing of spades ceased. Akim surveyed the pale worn faces of the men around him. Their coats and jackets lay in a careless heap on the snow. 

After a brief talk with Lagutin, Tokarev took the party to the excavation site, inviting Pankratov to join them. The stevedore walked alongside Zhukhrai. 

"Tell me, Pankratov, what happened at Motovilovka? Don't you think you overdid it disarming that Cheka man?" Fyodor asked the taciturn stevedore sternly. 

Pankratov grinned sheepishly. 

"It was all done by mutual consent," he explained. "He asked us to disarm him. He's a good lad. 

When we explained what it was all about, he says: 'I see your difficulty, boys, but I haven't the right to let you take those windows and doors away. We have orders from Comrade Dzerzhinsky to put a stop to the plunder of railway property. The station master here has his knife in me. He's stealing stuff, the bastard, and I'm in his way. If I let you get away with it he's bound to report me and I'll be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal. But you can disarm me and clear off. And if the station master doesn't report the matter that will be the end of it.' So that's what we did. After all, we weren't taking those doors and windows for ourselves, were we?" 

Noting the twinkle in Zhukhrai's eye, he went on: "You can punish us for it if you want to, but don't be hard on that lad, Comrade Zhukhrai." 

"That's all over and done with. But see there's no more of that in the future, it's bad for discipline. 

We are strong enough now to smash bureaucracy in an organised way. Now let's talk about something more important." And Fyodor proceeded to inquire about the details of the bandit raid.

About four and a half kilometres from Boyarka station a group of men were digging furiously into a rise in the ground that stood in the path of the line. Seven men armed with all the weapons the detachment possessed — Kholyava's rifle and the revolvers belonging to Korchagin, Pankratov, Dubava and Khomutov — stood on guard.

Patoshkin was sitting on top of the rise jotting down figures in his notebook. He was the only engineer on the job. Vakulenko, the technician, preferring to stand trial for desertion rather than death at a bandit's hand, had fled that morning.

"It will take two weeks to clear this hill out of the way. The ground's frozen hard," Patoshkin remarked in a low voice to the gloomy Khomutov standing beside him.

"We've been given twenty-five days to finish the whole line, and you're figuring fifteen for this,"

Khomutov growled, chewing the tip of his moustache.

"Can't be done, I'm afraid. Of course, I've never built anything before under such conditions and with workers like these. I may be mistaken. As a matter of fact I have been mistaken twice before."

At that moment Zhukhrai, Akim and Pankratov were seen approaching the slope.

"Look, who's that down there?" cried Pyotr Trofimov, a young mechanic from the railway workshops in an old sweater torn at the elbows. He nudged Korchagin and pointed to the newcomers. The next moment Korchagin, spade in hands, was dashing down the hill. His eyes under the peak of his helmet smiled a warm greeting and Fyodor lingered over their handshake.

"Hallo there, Pavel! Hardly recognised you in this rig-out."

Pankratov laughed drily: "Rig-out isn't the word for it. Plenty of ventilation holes anyway. The deserters pinched his overcoat, Okunev gave him that jacket — they've got a commune, you know. But Pavel's all right, he's got warm blood in his veins. He'll warm himself for a week or two more on the concrete floor — the straw doesn't make much difference — and then he'll be ready for a nice pine-wood coffin," the stevedore wound up with grim humour.

Dark-browed, snub-nosed Okunev narrowed his mischievous eyes and objected: "Never mind,we'll take care of Pavel. We can vote him a job in the kitchen helping Odarka. If he isn't a fool he can get himself a bit of extra grub and snuggle up to the stove or to Odarka herself."

A roar of laughter met this remark; it was the first time they had laughed that day.

Fyodor inspected the rise, then drove out with Tokarev and Patoshkin by sled to the timber felling.

When he returned, the men were still digging with dogged persistence into the hill. Fyodor noted the rapid movement of the spades, and the backs of the workers bent under the strain. Turning to Akim, he said in an undertone:

"No need of meetings. No agitation required here. You were right, Tokarev, when you said these lads are worth their weight in gold. This is where the steel is tempered."

Zhukhrai gazed at the diggers with admiration and stern, yet tender pride. Some of them only a short time back had stood before him bristling with the steel of their bayonets. That was on the night before the insurrection. And now, moved by a single impulse, they were toiling in order that the steel arteries of the railway might reach out to the precious source of warmth and life.

Politely but firmly Patoshkin showed Fyodor that it was impossible to dig through the rise in lessthan two weeks. Fyodor listened to his arguments with a preoccupied air, his mind clearly busywith some problem of its own.

"Stop all work on the cut and carry on farther up the line. We'll tackle that hill in a different way,"he said finally.

Down at the station he spent a long time at the telephone. Kholyava, on guard outside the door,heard Fyodor's hoarse bass from within.

"Ring up the chief of staff of the Military Area and tell him in my name to transfer Puzyrevsky's regiment to the railway job at once. The bandits must be cleared out of the area without delay.

Send an armoured train over with demolition men. I'll take care of the rest myself. I'll be back late.

Tell Litke to be at the station with the car by midnight."

In the barracks, after a short speech by Akim, Zhukhrai took the floor and an hour fled by in comradely discussion. Fyodor told the men there could be no question of extending the January 1 time limit allotted for the completion of the job.

"From now on we are putting the work on a military footing," he said. "The Party members will form a special task company with Comrade Dubava in command. All six work teams will receive definite assignments. The remainder of the job will be divided into six equal sectors, one for each team. By January 1 all the work must be completed. The team that finishes first will be allowed to go back to town. Also, the Presidium of the Gubernia Executive Committee is asking the Government to award the Order of the Red Banner to the best worker in the team that comes out first."

The leaders of the various teams were appointed as follows: No. 1, Comrade Pankratov, No. 2,Comrade Dubava, No. 3, Comrade Khomutov, No. 4, Comrade Lagutin, No. 5, Comrade

Korchagin, No. 6, Comrade Okunev.

"The chief of the job, its political and administrative leader will, as before, be Anton Nikiforovich Tokarev," Zhukhrai wound up with an oratorical flourish.

Like a flock of birds suddenly taking wing, the hand-clapping burst forth and stern faces relaxed in smiles. The warm whimsical conclusion to the speech relieved the strained attention of the meeting in a gust of laughter.

Some twenty men trooped down to the station to see Akim and Fyodor off.

As he shook hands with Korchagin, Fyodor glanced down at Pavel's snow-filled galosh.

"I'll send you a pair of boots," he said in a low voice. "You haven't frozen your feet yet, I hope?"

"They've begun to swell a bit," Pavel replied, then remembering something he had asked for a long time ago, he caught Fyodor by the arm. "Could you let me have a few cartridges for my revolver? I believe I only have three good ones left."

Zhukhrai shook his head in regret, but catching Pavel's disappointed look, he quickly unstrapped his own Mauser. "Here's a present for you."

Pavel could not believe at first that he was really getting something he had set his heart on for so long, but Zhukhrai threw the leather strap over his shoulder saying: "Take it, take it! I know you've had your eye on it for a long time. But take care you don't shoot any of our own men with it. Here are three full clips to go with it." Pavel felt the envious eyes of the others upon him. "Hey, Pavka," someone yelled, "I'll swap with you for a pair of boots and a sheepskin thrown in."

Pankratov nudged Pavel provokingly in the back.

"Come on, I'll give you a pair of felt boots for it. Anyway you'll be dead before Christmas with that galosh of yours."

With one foot on the step of the trolley for support, Zhukhrai wrote out a permit for the Mauser.

Early the next morning an armoured train clattered over the switches and pulled up at the station. 

The engine spouted plumes of steam as white as swansdown that vanished in the crystal-clear frosty air. Leather-clad figures emerged from the steel cars. A few hours later three demolition men from the train had planted in the earth of the hill two large black pumpkin-like objects with long fuses attached. They fired a few warning shots and the men scattered in all directions away from the now deadly hill. A match was put to the end of the fuse which flared up with a tiny phosphorescent flame. 

For a while the men held their breath. One or two moments of suspense, and then the earth trembled, and a terrific force rent the hill asunder, tossing huge chunks of earth skywards. The second explosion was more powerful than the first. The thunder of it reverberated over the surrounding forest, filling it with a confusion of sound. 

When the smoke and dust cleared a deep pit yawned where the hill had just stood, and the sugary snow was sprinkled with earth for dozens of paces all around. 

Men with picks and shovels rushed to the cavity formed by the explosion.

After Zhukhrai's departure, a stubborn contest for the honour of being the first to finish the job commenced among the teams. 

Long before dawn Korchagin rose quietly, taking care not to wake the others, and stepping cautiously on numb feet over the chilly floor made his way to the kitchen.

There he heated the water for tea and went back to wake up his team. 

By the time the others were up it was broad daylight. That morning Pankratov elbowed his way through the crowded barracks to where Dubava and his group were having their breakfast. 

"Hear that, Mityai?" he said heatedly. "Pavka went and got his lads up before daylight. I bet they've got a good twenty yards laid out by now. The fellows say he's got those railway repair shop boys all worked up to finish their section by the twenty-fifth. Wants to beat the rest of us hollow. But I say nothing doing!" 

Dubava gave a sour smile. He could understand why the secretary of the river-port Komsomol had been touched on the raw by what the railway repair shopmen had done. As a matter of fact his friend Pavel had stolen a march on him, Dubava, as well. Without saying a word to anyone he had simply challenged the whole company. 

"Friends or no friends, it's the best man who wins," Pankratov said. 

Around midday Korchagin's team was hard at work when an unexpected interruption occurred. 

The sentry standing guard over the rifles caught sight of a group of horsemen approaching through the trees and fired a warning shot. 

"To arms, lads! Bandits!" cried Pavel. He flung down his spade and rushed over to the tree where his Mauser hung. 

Snatching their rifles the others dropped down straight in the snow by the edge of the line. The leading horsemen waved their caps. 

"Steady there, Comrades, don't shoot!" one of them shouted.

Some fifty cavalrymen in Budyonny caps with bright red stars came riding up the road.

A unit of Puzyrevsky's regiment had come on a visit to the job. Pavel noticed that the commander's horse, a handsome grey mare with a white blaze on her forehead, had the tip of one ear missing. She pranced restlessly under her rider, and when Pavel rushed forward and seized her by the bridle, she shied away nervously.

"Why, Lyska old girl, I never thought we'd meet again! So the bullets didn't get you, my one-eared beauty."

He embraced her slender neck tenderly and stroked her quivering nostrils.

The commander stared at Pavel for a moment, then cried out in amazement: "Well, if it isn't Korchagin! You recognise the mare but you don't see your old pal Sereda.

Greetings, lad!"

In the meantime back in town pressure was being exerted in all quarters to expedite the building of the line, and this was felt at once at the job. Zharky had literally stripped the Komsomol District Committee of all the male personnel and sent them out to Boyarka. Only the girls were left at Solomenka. He got the railway school to send out another batch of students.

"I'm left here with the female proletariat," he joked, reporting the results of his work to Akim. "I think I'll put Talya Lagutina in my place, hang out the sign

'Women's Department' on the door and clear out to Boyarka myself. It's awkward for me here, the only man among all these women. You ought to see the nasty looks they give me. I'm sure they're saying: 'Look, the sly beggar sent everybody off, but stays on himself.' Or something worse still. You must let me go."

But Akim merely laughed at his words.

New workers continued to arrive at Boyarka, among them sixty students from the railway school.

Zhukhrai induced the railway administration to send four passenger carriages to Boyarka to house the newcomers.

Dubava's team was released from work and sent to Pushcha-Voditsa to bring back the engines and sixty-five narrow-gauge flatcars. This assignment was to be counted as part of the work on their section.

Before leaving, Dubava advised Tokarev to recall Klavicek from town and put him in charge of one of the newly-organised work teams at Boyarka. Tokarev did so. He did not know the real reason for Dubava's request: a note from Anna which the newcomers from Solomenka had brought.

"Dmitri!" Anna wrote. "Klavicek and I have prepared a pile of books for you. We send our warmest greetings to you and all the other Boyarka shock workers. You are all wonderful! We wish you strength and energy to carry on. Yesterday the last stocks of wood were distributed.

Klavicek asks me to send you his greetings. He is wonderful. He bakes all the bread for Boyarka,sifts the flour and kneads the dough high himself. He doesn't trust anyone in the bakery to do it.

He managed to get excellent flour and his bread is good, much better than the kind I get. In the evenings our friends gather in my place — Lagutina, Artyukhin,

Klavicek, and sometimes Zharky. We do a bit of reading but mostly we talk about everybody and everything, chiefly about you in Boyarka. The girls are furious with Tokarev for refusing to let them work on the railway. They say they can endure hardships as well as anyone. Talya declares she's going to dress up in her father's clothes and go out to Boyarka by herself. 'Let him just try to kick me out,' she says.

"I wouldn't be surprised if she kept her word. Please give my regards to your dark-eyed friend.

"Anna."

The blizzard came upon them suddenly. Low grey clouds spread themselves over the sky and the snow fell thickly. When night came the wind howled in the chimneys and moaned in the trees,

chasing the whirling snow-flakes and awakening the forest echoes with its malevolent whine.

All night long the storm raged in a wild fury, and although the stoves were kept warm throughout the night the men shivered; the wrecked station building could not hold the warmth.

In the morning they had to plough through the deep snow to reach their sections. High above the trees the sun shone in a blue sky without a single cloudlet to mar its clear expanse.

Korchagin and his men went to work to clear the snowdrifts from their section. Only now did Pavel realise how much a man could suffer from the cold. Okunev's threadbare jacket gave him scant protection and his galosh was constantly full of snow. He kept losing it in the snow, and now his other boot was threatening to fall apart. Two enormous boils had broken out on his neck — the result of sleeping on the cold floor. Tokarev had given him his towel to wear in place of a scarf.

Gaunt and red-eyed, Pavel was furiously plying his wooden snow shovel when a passenger train puffed slowly into the station. Its expiring engine had barely managed to haul it this far; there was not a single log of wood in the tender and the last embers were burning low in the firebox.

"Give us fuel and we'll go on, or else shunt us onto a siding while we still have the power to move!" the engine driver yelled to the station master.

The train was switched onto a siding. The reason for the halt was explained to the disgruntled passengers and a storm of complaints and curses broke out in the crowded carriages.

"Go and talk to that old chap," the station master advised the train guards, pointing to Tokarev who was walking down the platform.

"He's the chief of the job here. Maybe he can get wood brought down by sled to the engine.

They're using the logs for sleepers."

"I'll give you the wood, but you'll have to work for it," said Tokarev when" the conductors applied to him. "After all, it's our building material. We're being held up at the moment by the snow.

There must be about six or seven hundred passengers inside your train. The women and children can stay inside but let the men come and lend a hand clearing the snow until evening and I'll give you firewood. If they refuse they can stay where they are till New Year's."

"Look at the crowd coming this way! Look, women too!" Korchagin heard a surprised

exclamation at his back. He turned round. Tokarev came up.

"Here are a hundred helpers for you," he said. "Give them work and see none of them is idle."

Korchagin put the newcomers to work. One tall man in a smart railway uniform with a fur collar and a warm caracul cap indignantly twirled the shovel in his hands and turned to his companion, a young woman wearing a sealskin hat with a fluffy pompon on top.

"I am not going to shovel snow and nobody has the right to force me to do it. As a railway engineer I could take charge of the work if they ask me to, but neither you nor I need to shovel snow. It's contrary to the regulations. That old man is breaking the law. I can have him prosecuted.

Where is your foreman?" he demanded of the worker nearest him.

Korchagin came over.

"Why aren't you working?"

The man examined Pavel contemptuously from head to foot.

"And who may you be?"

"I am a worker."

"Then I have nothing to say to you. Send me your foreman, or whatever you call him...."

Korchagin scowled.

"You needn't work if you don't want to. But you won't get back on that train unless your ticket is countersigned by us. That's the construction chief's orders."

"What about you?" Pavel turned to the woman and was struck dumb with surprise. Before him stood Tonya Tumanova!

Tonya could hardly believe that this tramp who stood before her in his tattered clothing and incredible footwear, with a filthy towel around his neck and a face that had not been washed for many a day, was the Korchagin she once knew. Only his eyes blazed as fiercely as ever. The eyes of the Pavel she remembered. And to think that only a short while ago she had given her love to this ragged creature. How everything had changed!

She had recently married, and she and her husband were on their way to the city where he held an important position in the railway administration. Who could have thought that she would meet the object of her girlish affections in this way? She even hesitated to give him her hand. What would Vasili think? How awful of Korchagin to have fallen so low. Evidently the young stoker had not been able to rise above navvy work.

She stood hesitating, her cheeks burning. Meanwhile the railway engineer, infuriated by what he considered the insolence of this tramp who stood staring at his wife, flung down his shovel and went over to her side.

"Let us go, Tonya, I can't stand the sight of this lazzarone."

Korchagin had read Giuseppe Garibaldi and he knew what that word meant.

"I may be a lazzarone, but you're no more than a rotten bourgeois," he said hoarsely, and turning to Tonya, added curtly: "Take a shovel, Comrade Tumanova, and get into line. Don't take an example from this prize bull here. . .. Excuse me if he is any relation of yours."

Pavel glanced at Tonya's fur boots and smiled grimly, adding casually:

"I wouldn't advise you to stop over here. The other night we were attacked by bandits."

With that he turned on his heel and walked off, his galosh flapping as he went.

His last words impressed the railway engineer, and Tonya succeeded in persuading him to stay and work.

That evening, when the day's work was over, the crowd streamed back to the station. Tonya's husband hurried ahead to make sure of a seat in the train. Tonya, stopping to let a group of workers pass, saw Pavel trudging wearily behind the others, leaning heavily on his shovel.

"Hello, Pavlusha," she said and fell into step beside him. "I must say I never expected to find you in such straits. Surely the authorities ought to know you deserve something better than navvy's work? I thought you'd be a commissar or something like that by now. What a pity life has been so unkind to you...."

Pavel halted and surveyed Tonya with surprise.

"Nor did I expect to find you ... so stuffy," he said, choosing the most polite word he could think of to express his feelings.

The tips of Tonya's ears burned.

"You're just as rude as ever!"

Korchagin hoisted his shovel onto his shoulder and strode off. After a few steps he stopped.

"My rudeness, Comrade Tumanova," he said, "is not half as offensive as your so-called politeness.

And as for my life, please don't worry about that. There's nothing wrong with it. It's your life that's all wrong, ever so much worse than I expected. Two years ago you were better, you wouldn't have been ashamed to shake hands with a workingman. But now you reek of moth balls. To tell the truth, you and I have nothing more to say to each other."

Pavel had a letter from Artem announcing that he was going to be married and urging Pavel to come to the wedding without fail.

The wind tore the sheet of paper out of Pavel's hand and it flew off into the air. No wedding parties for him. How could he leave now? Only yesterday that bear Pankratov had outstripped his team and spurted forward at a pace that amazed everyone. The stevedore was making a desperate bid for first place in the contest. His usual nonchalance had forsaken him and he was whipping up his "water-fronters" to a furious tempo.

Patoshkin, noting the silent intensity with which the men worked, scratched his head perplexedly.

"Are these men or giants?" he marvelled. "Where do they get their incredible strength? If the weather holds out for only eight more days we'll reach the timber! Well, live and learn! These men are breaking all records and estimates." Klavicek came from town bringing the last batch of bread he had baked. He had a talk with Tokarev and then went off to hunt for Korchagin. The two men shook hands warmly. Klavicek with a broad smile dived into his knapsack and produced a handsome fur-lined leather jacket of Swedish make.

"This is for you!" he said stroking the soft leather. "Guess from whom? What! You don't know?

You are dense, man! It's from Comrade Ustinovich. So you shouldn't catch cold. Olshinsky gave it to her. She took it from him and handed it straight to me with orders to take it to you. Akim told her you've been going about in the frost with nothing but a thin jacket. Olshinsky's nose was put out of joint a bit. 'I can send the comrade an army coat,' he says. But Rita only laughed. 'Never mind,' she said, 'he'll work better in this jacket.' "

The astonished Pavel took the luxurious-looking jacket and after some hesitation slipped it on. Almost at once he felt the warmth from the soft fur spreading over his shoulders and chest.

Rita wrote in her diary:

December 20

"We have b

Part Two Chapter 3
---

But youth triumphed. Pavel did not succumb to the typhoid fever. For the fourth time he crossed the border line of death and came back to life. It was a whole month, however, before he was able to rise from his bed. Gaunt and pale, he tottered feebly across the room on his shaky legs, clinging to the wall for support. With his mother's help he reached the window and stood there for a long time looking out onto the road where pools of melted snow glittered in the early spring sunshine. 

It was the first thaw of the year. Just in front of the window a grey-breasted sparrow perched on the branch of a cherry-tree was preening its feathers, stealing quick uneasy glances at Pavel.

"So you and I got through the winter, eh?" Pavel said, softly tapping on the window pane.

His mother looked up startled.

"Who are you talking to out there?"

"A sparrow.... There now, he's flown away, the little rascal." And Pavel gave a wan smile.

By the time spring was at its height Pavel began to think of returning to town. He was now strong enough to walk, but some mysterious disease was undermining his strength. One day as he was walking in the garden a sudden excruciating pain in his spine knocked him off his feet. With difficulty he got up and dragged himself back to his room. The next day he submitted to a thorough medical examination. The doctor, examining Pavel's back, discovered a deep depression in his spine.

"How did you get this?" he asked.

"That was in the fighting near Rovno. A three-inch gun tore up the highway behind us and a stone hit me in the back."

"But how did you manage to walk? Hasn't it ever bothered you?"

"No. I couldn't get up for an hour or two after it happened, but then it passed and I got into the saddle again. It has never troubled me till now,"

The doctor's face was very grave as he carefully examined the depression.

"Yes, my friend, a very nasty business. The spine does not like to be shaken up like that. Let us hope that it will pass."

The doctor looked at his patient with undisguised concern.

One day Pavel went to see his brother. Artem lived with his wife's people. His wife Styosha was aplain-featured young peasant woman who came from a poverty-stricken family. A grimy slant-eyed urchin playing in the small, filthy yard stared fixedly at Pavel, picking his nose stolidly.

"What d'ye want?" he demanded. "Maybe you're a thief? You'd better clear off or you'll get it from my Ma!"

A tiny window was flung open in the shabby old cottage and Artem looked out.

"Come on in, Pavel!" he called.

An old woman with a face like yellowed parchment was busy at the stove. She flung Pavel an unfriendly look as he passed her and resumed her clattering with the pots.

Two girls with stringy pigtails clambered onto the stove ledge and stared down from there at the newcomer with the gaping curiosity of little savages.

Artem, sitting at the table, looked somewhat uncomfortable. He was aware that neither his mother nor his brother approved of his marriage. They could not understand why Artem, whose family had been proletarian for generations, had broken off with Galya, the stonemason's pretty daughter and a seamstress by trade whom he had been courting for three years, to go and live with a dull,ignorant woman like Styosha and be the breadwinner in a family of five. Now, after a hard day's work at the railway yard he had to toil at the plough in an effort to revive the run-down farm.

Artem knew that Pavel disapproved of his desertion to what he called the "petty-bourgeois elements", and he now watched his brother take stock of his surroundings.

They sat for a while exchanging a few casual remarks. Presently Pavel rose to go, but Art emdetained him.

"Wait a bit, and have a bite with us. Styosha will bring the milk in soon. So you're going away again tomorrow? Are you sure you're quite strong enough, Pavka?"

Styosha came in. She greeted Pavel, and asked Artem to go with her to the barn and help her carry something. Pavel was left alone with the dour old woman. Through the window came the sound of church bells. The old woman laid down her pothook and began to mutter sourly:

"Lord above, with all this cursed housework a body can scarce find time to pray!" She took off her shawl and, eyeing the newcomer askance, went over to the corner where hung the holy images,dreary and tarnished with age. Pressing together three bony fingers she crossed herself.

"Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name!" she whispered through withered lips.

The urchin playing outside in the yard leapt astride a black lop-eared hog. He dug his small bare heels smartly into its sides, clung to its bristles and shouted to the running, snorting beast: "Geeup, gee-up! Whoa! Whoa!"

The hog with the boy on its back dashed madly about the yard in a desperate effort to throw him,but the slant-eyed imp kept his seat firmly.

The old woman stopped praying and stuck her head out of the window.

"Get off that pig this minute, you little beast, or I'll wring your neck!"

The hog finally succeeded in shaking his tormentor off his back, and the old woman, mollified,returned to her icons, composed her features into a pious expression and continued:

"Thy kingdom come. . . ."

At that moment the boy appeared in the doorway, his face grimy with tears. Wiping his smarting nose with his sleeve and sobbing with pain, he whined:

"Gimme a pancake, Mummy!"

The old woman turned on him in a fury.

"Can't you see I'm praying, you cross-eyed devil, you? I'll give you pancakes, you limb of satan!..." And she snatched a whip from the bench. The boy was gone in a flash. The two little girls on top of the stove snickered.

The old woman returned to her devotions for the third time.

Pavel got up and went out without waiting for his brother. As he closed the gate behind him he noticed the old woman peering suspiciously out at him through the end window of the house.

"What evil spirit lured Artem out here?" he thought bitterly. "Now he's tied down for the rest of his life. Styosha will have a baby every year. And Artem will be stuck like a beetle on a dunghill.

He may even give up his work at the railway." Thus Pavel reflected gloomily as he strode down the deserted streets of the little town. "And I had hoped to be able to interest him in political work."

Pavel rejoiced at the thought that tomorrow he would be leaving this place and going to the big town to join his friends and comrades, all those dear to his heart. The big city with its bustling life and activity, its endless stream of humanity, its clattering trams and hooting automobiles drew him like a magnet. But most of all he yearned for the large brick factory buildings, the sootyworkshops, the machines, the low hum of transmission belts. He yearned for the mad spinning of the giant flywheels, for the smell of machine oil, for all that had become so much a part of him.

This quiet provincial town whose streets he now roamed filled him with a vague feeling of depression. He was not surprised that he felt a stranger here now. Even to take a stroll through the town in daytime had become an ordeal. Passing by the gossiping housewives sitting on their stoops, he could not help overhearing their idle chatter. 

"Now who could that scarecrow be?" 

"Looks like he had the consumption, lung trouble, that is." 

"A fine jacket he's got on. Stolen, I'll be bound." 

And plenty more in the same vein. Pavel was disgusted with it all. 

He had torn himself away from all this long ago. He felt a far closer kinship now with the big city to which he was bound by the strong, vitalising bonds of comradeship and labour. 

By now he had reached the pine woods, and he paused a moment at the road fork. To his right stood the old prison cut off from the woods by a high spiked fence, and beyond it the white buildings of the hospital. 

It was here on this broad common that the hangman's noose had choked the warm life out of Valya and her comrades. Pavel stood in silence on the spot where the gallows had been, then walked over to the bluff and down to the little cemetery where the victims of the Whiteguard terror lay in their common graves. Loving hands had laid spruce branches on the graves and built a neat green fence around the graveyard. The pines grew straight and slender on the top of the bluff and the young grass spread a silky green carpet over the slopes. 

There was a melancholy hush here on the outskirts of the town. The trees whispered gently and the fresh scent of spring rose from the regenerated earth. On this spot Pavel's comrades had gone bravely to their deaths that life might be beautiful for those born in poverty. 

Slowly Pavel raised his hand and removed his cap, his heart filled with sadness. 

Man's dearest possession is life. It is given to him but once, and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years, never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past; so live that, dying, he might say: all my life, all my strength were given to the finest cause in all the world 

— the fight for the Liberation of Mankind. And one must make use of every moment of life, lestsome sudden illness or tragic accident cut it short.

With these reflections, Korchagin turned away from the cemetery.

At home his mother was unhappily preparing for her son's departure. Watching her, Pavel saw that she was hiding her tears from him. 

"Perhaps you'll stay, Pavel dear?" she ventured. "It's hard for me to be left alone in my old age. It doesn't matter how many children you have, they all grow up and leave you. Why must you run off to the city? You can live here just as well. Or perhaps some bob-haired magpie there has caught your fancy? You boys never tell your old mother anything. Artem went and got married without a word to me and you're worse than him in that respect. I only see you when you get yourself crippled," his mother grumbled softly as she packed his meagre belongings into a clean bag. 

Pavel took her by the shoulders and drew her towards him. 

"No magpies for me, Mother! Don't you know that birds choose mates of their own species? And would you say I was a magpie?"

His mother smiled in spite of herself. 

"No, Mother, I've given my word to keep away from the girls until we've finished with all the bourgeois in the world. Bit long to wait, you say? No, Mother, the bourgeoisie can't hold out very long now. Soon there will be one big republic for all men, and you old folk who've worked all your lives will go to Italy, a beautiful warm country by the sea. There is no winter there, Mother. We'll install you in the rich men's palaces, and you'll lie about in the sun warming your old bones while we'll go and finish off the bourgeois in America." "That's a lovely fairy-tale, Son, but I shan't live to see it come true. . . . You're just like your grandad, the sailor, always full of ideas he was. A regular brigand, God forgive him! Finished up at Sevastopol and came home with one arm and one leg missing and two crosses and two silver medals on his chest. But he died poor. Bad-tempered too, he was. Hit some official over the head with his crutch once and was sent to jail for about a year. Even his military crosses didn't help him then. Yes, it's your grandad you take after and no mistake." 

"Now then, Ma, we can't have such a sorrowful farewell, can we? Let me have my accordion. I haven't touched it for a long time." 

He bent his head over the mother-of-pearl rows of keys and began to play. His mother, listening, caught a new quality in his music. He never used to play like this. The dashing, rollicking tunes with the trills and runs, the intoxicating rhythms for which the young accordionist had once been famed, were gone. His fingers had lost none of their power or skill, but the melody that flowed from under them now was richer and deeper. 

Pavel went to the station alone. 

He had persuaded his mother to stay at home for he knew that the final parting would upset her too much. 

The waiting crowd piled pell-mell into the train. Pavel climbed onto one of the topmost shelves and sat there watching the shouting, excited passengers arguing and gesticulating down below. 

As usual everyone carried packs and bundles which they shoved under the seats. 

As soon as the train got into motion the hubbub subsided somewhat and the passengers settled down to the business of stuffing themselves with food. 

Pavel soon fell asleep.

On his arrival in Kiev, Pavel set out at once for Kreshchatik Street in the heart of the city. Slowly he climbed onto the bridge. Everything was as it had been, nothing had changed. He walked across the bridge, sliding his hand over the smooth railings. There was not a soul on the bridge. He paused before descending to admire the majesty of the scene. The horizon was wrapped in the velvety folds of darkness, the stars sparkled and glittered with a phosphorescent glow. And down below, where the earth merged with the sky at some invisible point, the city scattered the darkness with a million lights. . . . 

Voices raised in argument invaded the stillness of the night and roused Pavel from his reverie. 

Someone was coming this way. Pavel tore his eyes away from the city lights and descended the stairs. 

At the Area Special Department the man on duty informed Pavel that Zhukhrai had left town a long time ago.

He questioned Pavel searchingly and, satisfied that the young man really was a personal friend of Zhukhrai, finally told him that Fyodor had been sent to work in Tashkent on the Turkestan front.

Pavel was so upset by the news that he turned and walked out without asking for further details. A sudden weariness made him sink down onto the doorstep to rest.

A tramcar clattered by, filling the street with its din. An endless stream of people flowed past him.

Pavel caught snatches of gay women's laughter, a rumbling bass, the high-pitched treble of a youth, the wheezy falsetto of an old man. The ebb and flow of hurrying crowds never ceased.

Brightly-lit trams, glaring automobile headlights, electric lights ablaze over the entrance to a cinema near by.... And everywhere — people, filling the street with their incessant hum of conversation.

The noise and bustle of the avenue dulled the edge of the pain caused by the news of Fyodor's departure. Where was he to go now? It was a long way to Solo-menka where his friends lived.

Suddenly he remembered the house on University Street. It was not far from here. Of course he would go there! After all, the first person he longed to see, after Fyodor, was Rita. And perhaps he could arrange to spend the night at Akim's place.

He saw a light in the end window from afar. Controlling his emotion with an effort he pulled open the heavy oaken outer door. For a few seconds he paused on the landing. Voices issued from Rita's room and someone was strumming on a guitar.

"Oho, so she allows guitars nowadays. Must have relaxed the regime," he said to himself. He tapped lightly on the door, biting his lip to quell his inner excitement.

The door was opened by a young woman with corkscrew curls. She looked questioningly at Korchagin.

"Whom do you want?"

She held the door ajar and a brief glance within told Pavel that his errand was fruitless.

"May I see Rita Ustinovich?"

"She's not here. She went to Kharkov last January and I hear she's in Moscow now."

"Does Comrade Akim still live here or has he left as well?"

"No, he isn't here either. He is Secretary of the Odessa Gubernia Komsomol now."

There was nothing to do but turn back. The joy of his return to the city had faded.

The problem now was to find somewhere to spend the night.

"You can walk your legs off trying to look up old friends who aren't there," he grumbled to himself, swallowing his disappointment. Nevertheless he decided to try his luck once more and see whether Pankratov was still in town. The stevedore lived in the vicinity of the wharves and that was nearer than Solomenka.

By the time he reached Pankratov's place he was utterly exhausted. "If he isn't here either I'll give up the search," Pavel vowed to himself as he knocked at a door that had once been painted yellow.

"I'll crawl under a boat and spend the night there."

The door was opened by an old woman with a kerchief tied under her chin. It was Pankratov's mother.

"Is Ignat home, Mother?"

"He's just come in."

She did not recognise Pavel, and turned round to call: "Ignat, someone to see you!"

Pavel followed her into the room and laid his knapsack on the floor. Pankratov, sitting at the table eating his supper, glanced quickly at the newcomer over his shoulder. 

"If it's me you want, sit down and fire away, while I get some borshch into my system," he said. 

"Haven't had a bite since morning." And he picked up a giant wooden spoon. 

Pavel sat on a rickety chair to one side. He took off his cap and, relapsing into an old habit, wiped his forehead with it. 

"Have I really changed so much that even Ignat doesn't recognise me?" he asked himself. 

Pankratov dispatched a spoon or two of borshch, but since his visitor said nothing, he turned his head to look at him. 

"Well, come on! What's on your mind?" 

His hand with the piece of bread remained suspended in mid air. He stared at his visitor blinking with astonishment. 

"Hey.... What's this? ... Well, of all the! ..." 

The sight of the confusion and bewilderment on Pankratov's red face was too much for Pavel and he burst out laughing. 

"Pavka!" cried the other. "But we all thought you were a goner! Wait a minute, now? What's your name again?" 

Pankratov's elder sister and his mother came running in from the next room at his shouts. All three began showering Pavel with questions until at last they finally satisfied themselves that it really was Pavel Korchagin and none other. 

Long after everyone in the house was fast asleep Pankratov was still giving Pavel an account of all that had happened during the past four months. 

"Zharky and Mityai went off to Kharkov last winter. And where do you think they went, the beggars? To the Communist University! Got into the preparatory course. There were fifteen of us at first. I also got into the spirit of the thing and applied. About time I got rid of some of the sawdust in my noodle, I thought. And would you believe it, that examination board flunked me!" 

Pankratov snorted at the memory and went on: "At first everything was fine. I fitted in on all counts: I had my Party card, I'd been in the Komsomol long enough, nothing wrong with my background and antecedents, but when it came to political knowledge I got into hot water. 

"I got into an argument with one of the chaps on the examining board. He comes at me with a nasty little question like this: 'Tell me, Comrade Pankratov, what do you know about philosophy?' 

Well, the fact is I didn't know a damned thing about philosophy. But there was a fellow used to work with us at the wharves, a grammar school student turned tramp, who had taken a job as a stevedore for the fun of it. Well, I remember him telling us about some brainy fellows in Greece who knew all the answers to everything, philosophers they called them, he said. Well, there was one chap, can't remember his name now, Diogineez or something like that, he lived all his life in a barrel. .. . The smartest of them all was the one who could prove forty times over that black was white and white was black. A lot of spoofers, you see? So I remembered what that student told me and I says to myself: 'Aha, he's trying to trip me up.' I see that examiner looking at me with a twinkle in his eye and I let him have it.

'Philosophy,' I says, 'is just poppycock, and I'm not going to have any truck with it, Comrades. The history of the Party, now, that's another matter. I'll be 

only too glad to have a crack at that.' Well, they went for me good and proper, wanted to know where I'd gotten those queer ideas of mine. So I told them about that student fellow and some of the things he'd said and the whole commission nearly split their sides. The laugh was on me all right. But I got sore and walked out.

"Later on that examiner fellow got hold of me in the Gubernia Committee and lectured me for a good three hours. It turns out that the student down at the docks had got things mixed up. It seems philosophy is all right, dashed important, as a matter o' fact.

"Dubava and Zharky passed the exams. Mityai was always good at studies, but Zharky isn't much better than me. Must have been his Order that got him by. Anyway I was left back here. After they went I was given a managing job at the wharves — assistant chief of the freight wharves. I always used to be scrapping with the managers about the youth and now I'm a manager myself. Nowadays if I come across some slacker or nitwit I haul him over the coals both as manager and Komsomol secretary. He can't throw dust in my eyes! Well, enough about me. What else is there to tell you?

You know about Akim already; Tufta is the only one of the old crowd left on the Gubernia Committee. Still on his old job. Tokarev is Secretary of the District Committee of the Party at Solomenka. Okunev, your fellow commune member, is on the Komsomol District Committee.

Talya works in the Political Education Department. Tsvetayev has your job down in the repair shops. I don't know him very well. We only meet occasionally in the Gubernia Committee; he seems to be quite a brainy fellow, but a bit standoffish. Remember Anna Borhart? She's at Solomenka too, head of the Women's Department of the District Party Committee. I've told you about all the others. Yes, Pavel, the Party's sent lots of folk off to study. All the old activists attend the Gubernia Soviet and Party School. They promise to send me too next year."

It was long past midnight when they retired for the night. By the time Pavel awoke the next morning, Pankratov had gone to the wharves. Dusya, his sister, a strapping lass closely resembling her brother, served Pavel tea, keeping up a lively patter of talk all the while. Pankratov the elder, a ship's engineer, was away from home.

As Pavel was preparing to go out, Dusya reminded him:"Don't forget now, we're expecting you for dinner."

The Gubernia Committee of the Party presented the usual scene of bustling activity. The front door opened and closed incessantly. The corridors and offices were crowded, and the muffled clicking of typewriters issued from behind the door of the Administration Department.

Pavel lingered in the corridor for a while in search of a familiar face, but finding no one he knew,went straight in to see the secretary. The latter, dressed in a blue Russian shirt, was seated behind a large desk. He looked up briefly as Pavel entered and went on writing.

Pavel took a seat opposite him and studied the features of Akim's successor.

"What can I do for you?" the secretary in the Russian shirt asked as he finished his writing.

Pavel told him his story.

"I want you to restore my membership and send me to the railway workshops," he wound up.

"Please issue the necessary instructions."

The secretary leaned back in his chair.

"Well put you back on the lists, of course, that goes without saying," he replied with some hesitation. "But it'll be a bit awkward to send you to the workshops.

Tsvetayev is there. He's a member of the Gubernia Committee. We'll have to find something else for you to do."

Korchagin narrowed his eyes.

"I don't intend to interfere with Tsvetayev's work," he said. "I'm going to work at my trade and not as secretary. And since my health is rather poor I would ask you not to assign me to any other job." 

The secretary agreed. He scribbled a few words on a slip of paper. 

"Give this to Comrade Tufta, he'll make all the arrangements." 

In the Personnel Department Pavel found Tufta giving a dressing down to his assistant. Pavel stood for a minute or two listening to the heated exchange, but since it threatened to last for a long time, he broke in. 

"You'll finish the argument another time, Tufta. Here's a note for you about fixing up my paper." 

Tufta stared. He looked from the paper to Korchagin, until at last it dawned on him, "I'll be damned! So you didn't die after all? Tut, tut, what are we going to do now? You've been struck off the lists. I myself turned in your card to the Central Committee. What's more, you've missed the census, and according to the circular from the Komsomol C.C. those who weren't registered in the census are out. So the only thing you can do is to file an application again in the regular way." Tufta's tone brooked no argument. 

Pavel frowned. 

"I see you haven't changed, Tufta. The same musty old bureaucrat. When will you learn to be human?" 

Tufta sprang up as if a flea had bitten him. 

"I would thank you not to lecture me. I am in charge here. Circular instructions are issued to be obeyed and not violated. And you'd better be careful with your accusations!" 

With these words, Tufta sat down and demonstratively drew the pile of unopened mail toward him. 

Pavel walked slowly to the door, then remembering something, he went back to the desk and picked up the secretary's slip that lay before Tufta. The latter watched him closely. He was a mean spiteful person, with nothing youthful about him, a trifle ridiculous with his big ears that seemed forever on the alert. 

"All right," Pavel said in a calm mocking voice. "You can accuse me of disorganising statistics if you like, but, tell me, how on earth do you manage to wangle reprimands for people who go and die without giving formal notice in advance? After all, anyone can get sick if he wants to, or die if he feels like it, there's nothing in the instructions about that, I bet." 

"Ho! Ho! Ho!" roared Tufta's assistant, no longer able to preserve his neutrality. 

The point of Tufta's pencil broke and he flung it on the floor, but before he had time to retort several people burst into the room, talking and laughing. Okunev was among them. There was much excitement when Pavel was recognised and endless questions were fired at him. A few minutes later another group of young people came in, Olga Yureneva with them. Dazed by the shock and delight of seeing Pavel again, Olga clung to his hand for a long time. 

Pavel had to tell his story all over again. The sincere joy of his comrades, their undisguised friendship and sympathy, the warm handclasps and friendly slaps on the back made Pavel forget about Tufta for the moment. 

But when he had finished his account of himself and told his comrades about his talk with Tufta there was a chorus of indignant comments. Olga, with an annihilating look at Tufta, marched off to the secretary's office.

"Come on, let's all go to Nezhdanov," cried Okunev. "He'll take care of him." And with these words he took Pavel by the shoulders and the whole group of young friends trooped after Olga into the office of the secretary. 

"That Tufta ought to be taken off the job and sent down to the wharves to work under Pankratov for a year. He's a hidebound bureaucrat!" stormed Olga. 

The Gubernia Committee secretary listened with an indulgent smile when Okunev, Olga and the others demanded that Tufta be dismissed from the Personnel Department. 

"Korchagin will be reinstated without question," he assured Olga. "A new card will be issued him at once. I agree with you that Tufta is a formalist," he went on. "That is his chief failing. But it must be admitted that he has not done so badly on the job. Komsomol personnel statistics wherever I have worked have always been in a state of indescribable chaos, not a single figure could be relied on. In our Personnel Department the statistics are in good order. You know yourselves that Tufta often sits up nights working. Here's how I look at it: he can always be removed, But if his place is taken by some free and easy chap who knows nothing about keeping records, we may not have any bureaucracy, but neither will we have any order. Let him stay on the job. I'll give him a good talking to. That will help for a while and later on we'll see." 

"All right, let him be," Okunev agreed. "Come on, Pavel, let's go to Solomenka. There's a meeting at the club tonight. Nobody knows you're back yet. Think what a surprise they'll get when we announce: 'Korchagin has the floor!' You're a great lad, Pavel, for not dying. What good would you be to the proletariat dead?" And Okunev threw his arm around his friend and piloted him down the corridor. 

"Will you come, Olga?" 

"Of course I will." 

Korchagin did not return to the Pankratovs for dinner, in fact he did not go back there at all that day. Okunev took him to his own room in the House of Soviets. He gave him the best meal he could muster, then placed a pile of newspapers and two thick files of the minutes of the District Komsomol Bureau meetings before him with the advice: "Glance through this stuff. Lots of things happened while you were frittering away your time with the typhus. I'll come back toward evening and we'll go to the club together. You can lie down and take a nap if you get tired." 

Stuffing his pockets full with all kinds of papers and documents (Okunev scorned the use of a portfolio on principle and it lay neglected under his bed), the District Committee secretary said good-bye and went out. 

When he returned that evening the floor of his room was littered with newspapers and a heap of books had been moved out from under the bed. Some of them were piled on the table. Pavel was sitting on the bed reading the last letters of the Central Committee which he had found under his friend's pillow. 

"A fine mess you've made of my quarters, you ruffian!" Okunev cried in mock indignation. "Hey, wait a minute, Comrade! Those are secret documents you're reading! That's what I get for letting a nosy chap like you into my den!" 

Pavel, grinning, laid the letter aside. 

"This particular one doesn't happen to be secret," he said, "but the one you're using for a lampshade is marked 'confidential'. Look, it's all singed around the edges!"

Okunev took the scorched slip of paper, glanced at the title and struck himself on the forehead in dismay.

"I've been looking for the damn thing for three days! Couldn't imagine where it had got to. Now I remember. Volyntsev made a lampshade out of it the other day and then he himself searched for it high and low." Okunev folded the document carefully and stuffed it under the mattress. "We'll put everything in order later on," he said reassuringly. "Now for a bite and then off to the club. Pull up to the table, Pavel!"

From one pocket he produced a long dried roach wrapped in newspaper and from the other, two slices of bread. He spread the newspaper out on the table, took the roach by the head and whipped it smartly against the table's edge to soften it. Sitting on the table and working vigorously with his jaws, the jolly Okunev gave Pavel all the news, cracking jokes the while.

At the club Okunev took Korchagin through the back entrance behind the stage. In the corner of the spacious hall, to the right of the stage near the piano sat Talya Lagutina and Anna Borhart with a group of Komsomols from the railway district. Volyntsev, the Komsomol secretary of the railway shops, was sitting opposite Anna. He had a face as ruddy as an August apple, hair and eyebrows the colour of ripe corn. His once black leather jacket was extremely shabby.

Next to him, his elbow resting negligently on the lid of the piano, sat Tsvetayev, a handsome young man with brown hair and finely chiselled lips. His shirt was unbuttoned at the throat.

As he came up to the group, Okunev heard Anna say:

"Some people are doing everything they can to complicate the admission of new members.

Tsvetayev is one."

"The Komsomol is not a picnic ground," Tsvetayev snapped with stubborn disdain.

"Look at Nikolai!" cried Talya, catching sight of Okunev. "He's beaming like a polished samovar tonight!"

Okunev was dragged into the circle and bombarded with questions.

"Where have you been?"

"Let's get started."

Okunev raised his hand for silence.

"Hold on, lads. As soon as Tokarev comes we'll begin."

"There he comes now," remarked Anna.

Sure enough the Secretary of the District Party Committee approached. Okunev ran forward to meet him.

"Come along, Dad, I'm going to take you backstage to meet a friend of mine. Prepare for a shock!"

"What're you up to now?" the old man growled, puffing on his cigarette, but Okunev was already pulling him by the sleeve.

Okunev rang the chairman's bell with such violence that even the noisiest members of the audience were silenced.

Behind Tokarev the leonine head of the genius of the Communist Manifesto, in a frame of evergreen, surveyed the assembly. While Okunev opened the meeting Tokarev could not keep his eyes off Korchagin who stood in the wings waiting for his cue.

"Comrades! Before we get down to the current organisational questions on the agenda, a comrade here has asked for the floor. Tokarev and I move that he be allowed to speak."

A murmur of approval rose from the hall, whereupon Okunev rapped out:

"I call upon Pavel Korchagin to address the meeting!"

At least eighty of the one hundred in the hall knew Korchagin, and when the familiar figure appeared before the footlights and the tall pale young man began to speak, a storm of delighted cries and thunderous applause broke from the audience.

"Dear Comrades!"

Korchagin's voice was steady but he could not conceal his emotion.

"Friends, I have returned to take my place in the ranks. I am happy to be back. I see a great number of my comrades here. I understand that the Solomenka Komsomol has thirty per cent more members than before, and that they've stopped making cigarette lighters in the workshops and yards, and the old carcasses are being hauled out of the railway cemetery for capital repairs.

That means our country is getting a new lease on life and is mustering its strength. That is something to live for! How could I die at a time like this!" Korchagin's eyes lit up in a happy smile.

Amid a storm of applause and greetings he descended the platform and went over to where Anna and Talya were sitting. He shook the hands outstretched in greeting, and then the friends moved up and made room for him between them. Talya laid her hand on his and squeezed it tight. Anna's eyes were still wide with surprise, her eyelashes quivered faintly as she gave Pavel a look of warm welcome.

The days slipped swiftly by. Yet there was nothing monotonous about their passage, for each day brought something new, and as he planned his work in the morning Pavel would note with chagrin that the day was all too short and much of what he had planned remained undone.

Pavel had moved in with Okunev. He worked at the railway shops as assistant electrical fitter.

He had had a long argument with Okunev before the latter agreed to his temporary withdrawal from work in the Komsomol leadership.

"We're too short of people for you to cool your heels in the workshops," Okunev had objected.

"Don't tell me you're ill. I hobbled about with a stick myself for a whole month after the typhus.

You can't fool me, Pavel, I know you, there's something behind all this. Come on, out with it,"Okunev insisted.

"You're right, Kolya, there is. I want to study."

"There you are!" Okunev cried exultantly. "I knew it! Do you think I don't want to study too? It's downright egoism on your part. Expect us to put our shoulders to the wheel while you go off to study. Nothing doing, my lad, tomorrow you start as organiser."

Nevertheless, after a lengthy discussion Okunev gave in.

"Very well, I'll leave you alone for two months. And I hope you appreciate my generosity. But I don't think you'll get along with Tsvetayev, he's a bit too conceited."

Pavel's return to the workshops had put Tsvetayev on the alert. He was certain that Korchagin's coming would mark the beginning of a struggle for leadership. His self-esteem was wounded and he prepared to put up a stiff resistance. He soon saw, however, that he had been mistaken. When Korchagin learned that there was a plan afoot to make him a member of the Komsomol Bureau he went straight to the Komsomol secretary's office and persuaded him to strike the question off the agenda, giving his understanding with Okunev as the excuse. In the Komsomol shop cell Pavel took a political study class, but did not ask for work in the Bureau. Nevertheless, although he had officially no part in the leadership, Pavel's influence was felt in all phases of the collective's work. 

In his comradely, unobtrusive fashion he helped Tsvetayev out of difficulties on more than one occasion. 

Coming into the shop one day Tsvetayev was amazed to see all the members of the Komsomol cell and some three dozen non-Party lads busy washing windows, scraping many years' accumulation of filth off the machines and carting heaps of rubbish out into the yard. Pavel, armed with a huge mop, was furiously scrubbing the cement floor which was covered with machine oil and grease. 

"Spring-cleaning? What's the occasion?" Tsvetayev asked Pavel. 

"We're tired of all this muck. The place hasn't been cleaned for a good twenty years, we'll make it look like new in a week," Korchagin replied briefly. 

Tsvetayev shrugged his shoulders and went away. 

Not content with cleaning out their workshop, the electricians tackled the factory yard. For years the huge yard had served as a dumping ground for all manner of disused equipment. There were hundreds of carriage wheels, and axles, mountains of rusty iron, rails, buffers, axle boxes — several thousand tons of metal lay rusting under the open sky. But the factory management put a stop to the young people's activities. 

"We have more important things to attend to. The yard can wait," they were told. 

And so the electricians paved a small area of the yard outside the entrance to their shop, placing a wire mat outside the door and left it at that. But inside their shop the cleaning continued after working hours. When Strizh, the chief engineer, dropped in a week later he found the workshop flooded with light. The huge iron barred windows, freed from their heavy layer of dust and oil, now admitted the sunlight which was reflected brightly in the polished copper parts of the diesel engines. The heavy parts of the machines shone with a fresh coat of green paint, and someone had even painted yellow arrows on the spokes of the wheels. 

"Well, well..." Strizh muttered in amazement. 

In the far corner of the shop a few of the men were finishing their work. Strizh went over. On the way he met Korchagin carrying a tin of paint. 

"Just a moment, my friend," the engineer stopped him. "I fully approve of what you have done here. But where did you get that paint? Haven't I given strict orders that no paint is to be used without my permission? We can't afford to waste paint for such purposes. We need all we've got for the engine parts." 

"This paint was scraped out of the bottoms of discarded cans. We spent two days on it but we scraped out about twenty-five pounds. We're not breaking any laws here, Comrade Engineer." 

The engineer snorted again, but he looked rather sheepish. 

"Then carry on, of course. Well, well. Now this is really interesting. How do you explain this ... 

what shall we call it ... this voluntary striving for cleanliness in a workshop? All done after working hours, I take it?" 

Korchagin detected a note of genuine perplexity in the engineer's voice. 

"Of course," he said. "What did you suppose?" 

"Yes, but...." 

"There is nothing to be surprised at, Comrade Strizh. Who told you that the Bolsheviks are going to leave dirt alone? Wait till we get this thing going properly. We have some more surprises in store for you." 

And carefully skirting the engineer so as to avoid splashing him with paint, Korchagin moved on. 

Every evening found Pavel in the public library where he lingered until late. He had made friends with all the three librarians, and by using all his powers of persuasion he had finally won the right to browse freely among the books. Propping the ladder against the tall bookcases he would sit there for hours leafing through volume after volume. Most of the books were old. Modern literature occupied one small bookcase — a few odd Civil War pamphlets, Marx's Capital, The Iron Heel by Jack London and several others. Rummaging among the old books he came across Spartacus. He read it in two nights and when he finished it he placed it on the shelf alongside the works of Maxim Gorky. This gradual selection of the more interesting books with a modern revolutionary message lasted for some time. 

The librarians did not object.

The calm routine of Komsomol life at the railway shops was suddenly disturbed by what appeared at first to be an insignificant incident: repair worker Kostya Fidin, member of the cell bureau, a sluggish lad with a snub nose and a pock-marked face, broke an expensive imported drill on a piece of iron. The accident was the result of downright carelessness; worse, it looked like deliberate mischief on Fidin's part. 

It happened in the morning. Khodorov, senior repair foreman, had told Kostya to drill several holes in an iron plate. Kostya refused at first, but on the foreman's insistence he picked up the iron and started to drill it. The foreman, an exacting taskmaster, was not popular with the workers. A former Menshevik, he took no part in the social life of the plant and did not approve of the Young Communists. But he was an expert at his job and he performed his duties conscientiously. 

Khodorov noticed that Kostya was drilling "dry", without using any oil. He hurried over to the machine and stopped it. 

"Are you blind or what? Don't you know better than to use a drill that way!" he shouted at Kostya, knowing that the drill would not last long with such handling. 

Kostya snapped back at him and restarted the lathe. Khodorov went to the department chief to complain. Kostya in the meantime, leaving the machine running, hurried off to fetch the oiling can so that everything would be in order by the time the chief appeared. When he returned with the oil the drill was broken. The chief submitted a report recommending Fidin's dismissal. The bureau of the Komsomol cell, however, took up the cudgels on Fidin's behalf on the grounds that Khodorov had a grudge against all active Komsomol members. The management insisted on Fidin's dismissal, and the case was put before the Komsomol bureau of the workshops. The fight was on. 

Three of the five members of the bureau were in favour of giving Kostya an official reprimand and transferring him to other work. Tsvetayev was one of the three. The other two did not think Fidin should be punished at all. 

The bureau meeting to discuss the case was called in Tsvetayev's office. Around a large table covered with red cloth stood several benches and stools made by the Komsomols of the carpenter shops. There were portraits of the leaders on the walls, and the railway workshops' banner was spread over one entire wall behind the table. 

Tsvetayev was now a "full-time" Komsomol worker. He was a blacksmith by trade, but being a good organiser had been promoted to a leading post in the Komsomol: he was now a member of the Bureau of the Komsomol District Committee and a member of the Gubernia Committee besides. He was a newcomer to the railway shops. From the first he had taken the reins of management firmly into his hands. Self-assured and hasty in his decisions, he had suppressed the initiative of the other Komsomol members from the outset. He insisted on doing everything himself — even the office had been decorated under his personal supervision — and when he found himself unable to cope with all the work, stormed at his assistants for their inactivity. 

He conducted the meeting sprawled in the only soft armchair in the room which had been brought from the club. It was a closed meeting. Khomutov, the Party organiser, had just asked for the floor, when there was a knock on the door which was closed on the latch. Tsvetayev scowled at the interruption. The knock was repeated. Katya Zelenova got up and opened the door. Korchagin stood on the threshold. Katya let him in. 

Pavel was making his way to a vacant seat when Tsvetayev addressed him. 

"Korchagin, this is a closed meeting of the bureau." 

The blood rushed to Pavel's face, and he turned slowly to face the table. 

"I know that. I am interested in hearing your opinion on the Fidin case. I have a point to raise in connection with it. What's the matter, do you object to my presence?" 

"I don't object, but you ought to know that closed meetings are attended only by bureau members. 

The more people there are the harder it is to thrash things out properly. But since you're here you might as well stay." 

Korchagin had never suffered such a slight. A crease appeared on his forehead. 

"What's all the formality about?" Khomutov remarked disapprovingly, but Korchagin stopped him with a gesture, and sat down. "Well, this is what I wanted to say," Khomutov went on. "It's true that Khodorov belongs to the old school, but something ought to be done about discipline. If all the Komsomols go smashing up drills, there'll be nothing to work with. What's more, we're giving a rotten example to the non-Party workers. In my opinion the lad ought to be given a serious warning." 

Tsvetayev did not give him a chance to finish, and began voicing his objections. Ten minutes passed. In the meantime Korchagin saw which way the wind was blowing. When the matter was finally put to the vote he got up and asked for the floor. Tsvetayev reluctantly permitted him to speak. 

"I should like to give you my opinion of the Fidin case, Comrades," Pavel began. His voice sounded harsh in spite of himself. 

"The Fidin case is a signal, and it is not Kostya's action in itself that's most important. I collected some-figures yesterday." Pavel took a notebook out of hispocket. "I got them from the timekeeper. Now listen carefully: twenty-three per cent of our Komsomols come to work from five to fifteen minutes late every day. That has become a rule. Seventeen per cent don't report for work at all one or two days out of every month; the percentage of absenteeism among young non-Party workers is fourteen per cent. These figures sting worse than a whiplash, Comrades. I jotted down a few more: four per cent of our Party members are absent one day a month, and four per cent report late for work. Of the non-Party workers eleven per cent miss one day in the month while thirteen per cent regularly report late for work. Ninety per cent of breakages are accounted for by young workers, seven per cent of whom are newcomers. The conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that we Komsomols are making a far worse showing than the Party members and adult workers. But the situation is not the same everywhere. The foundry record is excellent, the electricians are not so bad, but the rest are more or less on the same level. In my opinion Comrade Khomutov said only a fraction of what ought to be said about discipline. The mmediate problem now is to straighten out these zigzags. I don't intend to begin agitating here, but we've got to put a stop to carelessness and sloppiness. The old workers are frankly admitting that they used to work much better for the master, for the capitalist, but now we're the masters and there's no excuse for working badly. It's not so much Kostya or any other worker who's to blame. We ourselves, all of us, are at fault because instead of fighting the evil properly we sometimes defend workers like Kostya under one or another pretext. 

"Samokhin and Butylyak have just said here that Fidin is a good lad, one of the best, an active Komsomol and all that. What if he did bust a drill, it could happen to anybody. He's one of us, while the foreman isn't... . But has anyone ever tried to talk to Khodorov? Don't forget that grumbler has thirty years of working experience behind him! We won't talk about his politics. In the given case he is in the right, because he, an outsider, is taking care of state property while we are smashing up valuable tools. What do you call such a state of affairs? I believe that we ought to strike the first blow now and launch an offensive on this sector. 

"I move that Fidin be expelled from the Komsomol as a slacker and disorganiser of production. 

His case should be discussed in the wall newspaper, and these figures published in an editorial article openly without fear of the consequences. We are strong, we have forces we can rely on. 

The majority of the Komsomol members are good workers. Sixty of them have gone through Boyarka and that was a severe test. With their help and their assistance we can iron out the difficulties. Only we've got to change our attitude to the whole business once and for all." 

Korchagin, usually calm and reticent, spoke with a passion that surprised Tsvetayev. He was seeing the real Pavel for the first time. He realised that Pavel was right, but he was too cautious to agree with him openly. He took Korchagin's speech as a harsh criticism of the general state of the organisation, as an attempt to undermine his, Tsvetayev's, authority, and he resolved to make short shrift of his opponent. He began his speech by accusing Korchagin of defending the Menshevik Khodorov. 

The stormy debate lasted for three hours. Late that night the final point was reached. Defeated by the inexorable logic of facts and having lost the majority to Korchagin, Tsvetayev made a false step. He violated the rules of democracy by ordering Korchagin to leave the room just before the final vote was taken. 

"Very well, I shall go, although your behaviour does not do you credit, Tsvetayev. I warn you that if you continue to insist on your viewpoint I shall put the matter before the general meeting tomorrow and I am sure you will not be able to win over the majority there. You are not right, Tsvetayev. I think, Comrade Khomutov, that it is your duty to take up the question with the Party group before the general meeting." 

"Don't try to scare me," Tsvetayev shouted defiantly. "I can go to the Party group myself, and what's more I have something to tell them about you. If you don't want to work yourself, don't interfere with those who do." 

Pavel closed the door behind him. He passed his hand over his burning forehead and went through the empty office to the exit. Outside on the street he took a deep breath of air, lit a cigarette and set out for the little house on Baty Hill where Tokarev lived. 

He found the old mechanic at supper. 

"Come on, let's hear the news. Darya, bring the lad a plate of gruel," said Tokarev, inviting Pavel to the table. 

Darya Fominishna, Tokarev's wife, as tall and buxom as her husband was short and spare, placed a plate of millet gruel before Pavel and wiping her moist lips with the edge of her white apron said kindly: "Set to, dearie." 

Pavel had been a frequent visitor at the Tokarevs' in the days when the old man worked in the repair shops, and had spent many a pleasant evening with the old couple, but this was his first visit since his return to the city. 

The old mechanic listened attentively to Pavel's story, working busily with his spoon and making no comment apart from an occasional grunt. When he had finished his porridge, he wiped his moustache with his handkerchief and cleared his throat. 

"You're right, of course," he said. "It's high time the question was put properly. There are more Komsomols down at the workshops than anywhere else in the district and that's where we ought to start. So you and Tsvetayev have come to blows after all, eh? Too bad. He's a bit of an upstart, of course. You used to get on with the lads, didn't you? By the way, what exactly is your job at the shops?" 

"I'm working in one of the departments. And generally I'm in on everything that's doing. In my own cell I lead a political study circle." 

"What about the bureau?" 

Korchagin hesitated. 

"I thought that while I still felt a bit shaky on my legs, and since I wanted to do some studying, I wouldn't take part officially in the leadership for a while." 

"So that's it!" Tokarev cried in disapproval. "Now, my boy, if it weren't for your health I'd give you a good scolding. How do you feel now, by the way? Stronger?" 

"Yes." 

"Good, and now get to work in earnest. Stop beating about the bush. No good will come of sitting on the sidelines! You're just trying to evade responsibility and you know it. You must put things to rights tomorrow. Okunev will hear from me about this." Tokarev's tone showed his annoyance. 

"No, dad, you leave him alone," Pavel hastened to object. "I asked him not to give me any work." 

Tokarev whistled in scorn. 

"You did, eh, and he let you off? Oh well, what can we do with you, Komsomols. . . . Will you read me the paper, son, the way you used to? My eyes aren't as good as they might be."

The Party bureau at the workshops upheld the decision of the majority in the Komsomol bureau. 

The Party and Komsomol groups undertook the important and difficult task of setting an example of labour discipline. Tsvetayev was given a thorough dressing down at the bureau. He tried to bluster at first but pinned to the wall by Lopakhin, the Secretary, an elderly man with the waxen pallor of the consumptive, Tsvetayev gave in and partly admitted his error.

The following day the wall newspaper carried a series of articles that caused something of a sensation at the railway shops. The articles were read aloud and hotly discussed, and the unusually well-attended youth meeting held that same evening dealt exclusively with the problems they raised.

Fidin was expelled from the Komsomol, and a new member was added to the bureau in charge of political education — Korchagin.

Unusual quiet reigned in the hall as the meeting listened to Nezhdanov outline the new tasks confronting the railway workshops at this new stage.

After the meeting Tsvetayev found Korchagin waiting for him outside.

"I have something to say to you," Pavel said.

"What about?" Tsvetayev asked sourly.

Pavel took him by the arm and after they had gone a few yards paused at a bench.

"Shall we sit down for a moment?" he suggested and set the example.

The burning tip of Tsvetayev's cigarette now glowed red, now faded.

"What have you got against me, Tsvetayev?"

There was silence for a few minutes.

"Oh, so that's it? I thought you wanted to talk business," Tsvetayev said feigning surprise, but his voice was unsteady.

Pavel laid his hand firmly on the other's knee.

"Get off your high horse, Dimka. That sort of talk is only for diplomats. You tell me this: why have you taken such a dislike to me?"

Tsvetayev shifted uneasily in his seat.

"What are you talking about? Why should I have anything against you? I offered you work, didn't I? You refused, and now you're accusing me of trying to keep you out."

But his words carried no conviction, and Pavel, his hand still on Tsvetayev's knee, went on with feeling:

"If you won't say it, I will. You think I want to cramp your style, you think it's your job I'm after.

If you didn't, we wouldn't have quarrelled over the Kostya affair. Relations like these can ruin our work. If this concerned only the two of us it wouldn't matter — I wouldn't care what you thought of me. But from tomorrow we'll be working together. How can we carry on like this? Now listen.

There must be no rift between us. You and I are both workingmen. If our cause is dearer to you than everything else you'll give me your hand on it, and tomorrow we'll start as friends. But unless you throw all this nonsense out of your head and steer clear of intrigues, you and I will fight like blazes over every setback in the work that results. Now here's my hand, take it, while it is still proffered to you in friendship."

A deep sense of satisfaction swept Korchagin as Tsvetayev's rough fingers closed over his palm.

A week passed. The workday was coming to an end in the District Committee of the Party. Quiet settled over the offices. But Tokarev was still at his desk. He was sitting in his armchair studying the latest reports, when a knock came at the door.

"Come in!"

Korchagin entered and placed two filled out questionnaire blanks on the Secretary's desk.

"What's this?"

"It's an end to irresponsibility, Dad. And high time, if you ask me. If you are of the same opinion I would be grateful for your support."

Tokarev glanced at the heading, looked up quickly at the young man, then picked up his pen.

Under the head: "Party standing of comrades recommending Pavel Andreyevich Korchagin for candidate membership in the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" he wrote

"1903" with a firm hand, and signed his name.

"There, my son. I know that you will never bring disgrace upon my old grey head."

The room was suffocatingly hot. One thought was uppermost in everyone's mind: to get away to the cool shade of the chestnut trees of Solomenka as quickly as possible.

"Wind up, Pavel, I can't stand another minute of this," implored Tsvetayev, who was sweating profusely. Katyusha and the others supported him.

Pavel Korchagin closed the book and the study circle broke up.

As they rose the old-fashioned Ericson telephone on the wall jangled. Tsvetayev, who answered its summons, had to shout to make himself heard above the clamour of voices in the room.

He hung up the receiver and turned to Korchagin.

"There are two diplomatic railway carriages down at the station belonging to the Polish consulate.

Their lights are out, something's gone wrong with the wiring. The train leaves in an hour. Get some tools together and run down there, Pavel. It's urgent."

The two sleepers gleaming with polished brass and plate glass stood at the first platform. The saloon-carriage with its wide windows was brightly lit. But the neighbouring carriage was in darkness.

Pavel went up to the steps of the luxurious carriage and gripped the handrail with the intention of entering the carriage.

A figure hastily detached itself from the station wall and seized him by the shoulder.

"Where are you going?"

The voice was familiar. Pavel turned and took in the leather jacket, broad-peaked cap, the thin,hooked nose and the suspicious look in the eyes.

It was Artyukhin. He had not recognised Pavel at first, but now his hand fell from Pavel's shoulder, and his grim features relaxed although his glance paused questioningly on the instrument case.

"Where were you heading for?" he said in a less formal tone.

Pavel briefly explained. Another figure appeared from behind the carriage.

"Just a moment, I'll call their guard." Several people in expensive travelling clothes were sitting in the saloon-carriage when Korchagin entered on the heels of the guard. A woman sat with her back to the door at a table covered with a damask cloth. When Pavel entered she was chatting with a tall officer. They stopped talking when the electrician appeared.

Korchagin made a rapid examination of the wiring which ran from the last lamp into the corridor, and finding it in order, left the carriage to continue his search for the damage. The stout, bullnecked guard, in a uniform resplendent with large brass buttons bearing the Polish eagle, kept close at his heels. 

"Let's try the next carriage, everything is in order here. The trouble must be there." 

The guard turned the key in the door and they passed into the darkened corridor. Training his torch on the wiring Pavel soon found the spot where the short circuit had occurred. A few minutes later the first lamp went on in the corridor suffusing it with opaque light. 

"The bulbs inside the compartment will have to be changed. They have burned out," Korchagin said to his guide. 

"In that case I'll have to call the lady, she has the key." Not wishing to leave the electrician alone in the carriage, the guard bade him to follow. 

The woman entered the compartment first, Korchagin followed. The guard remained standing in the doorway, blocking the entrance. Pavel noted the two elegant leather travelling bags, a silken cloak flung carelessly on the seat, a bottle of perfume and a small malachite vanity case on the table under the window. The woman sat down in a corner of the couch, patted her fair hair and watched the electrician at work. 

"Will madam permit me to leave for a moment?" the guard said obsequiously, inclining his bull neck with some difficulty. "The Major has asked for some cold beer." 

"You may go," replied the woman in an affected voice. 

The exchange had been in Polish. 

A shaft of light from the corridor fell on the woman's shoulder. Her exquisite gown of fine silk made by the best Paris dress designers left her shoulders and arms bare. In the lobe of each delicate ear a diamond drop blazed and sparkled. Korchagin could only see one ivory shoulder and arm. The face was in shadow. Working swiftly with his screwdriver Pavel changed the outlet in the ceiling and a moment later the lights went on in the compartment. Now he had only to examine the other bulb over the sofa on which the woman sat. 

"I need to test that bulb," Korchagin said, pausing in front of her. 

"Oh yes, I am in your way," the lady replied in perfect Russian. She rose lightly and stood close beside him. Now he had a full view of her. The arched eyebrows and the pursed, disdainful l

Part Two Chapter 4
---

This is the frontier — two posts facing one another in silent hostility, each standing for a world of its own. One of them is planed and polished and painted black and white like a police box, and topped by a single-headed eagle nailed in place with sturdy spikes. Wings outspread, claws gripping the striped pole, hooked beak outstretched, the bird of prey stares with malicious eyes at the cast-iron shield with the sickle-and-hammer emblem on the opposite pole — a sturdy, round, rough-hewn oak post planted firmly in the ground. The two poles stand six paces apart on level ground, yet there is a deep gulf between them and the two worlds they stand for. To try to cross this no man's land means risking one's life. 

This is the frontier. 

From the Black Sea over thousands of kilometres to the Arctic Ocean in the Far North stands the motionless line of these silent sentinels of the Soviet Socialist Republics bearing the great emblem of labour on their iron shields. The post with the rapacious bird marks the beginning of the border between Soviet Ukraine and bourgeois Poland. It stands ten kilometres from the small town of Berezdov tucked away in the Ukrainian hinterland, and opposite it is the Polish townlet of Korets. 

From Slavuta to Anapol the border area is guarded by a Frontier Guard battalion. 

The frontier posts march across the snowbound fields, push through clearings cut in forests, plunge down valleys and, heaving themselves up hillsides, disappear behind the crests only to pause on the high bank of a river to survey the wintry plains of an alien land. 

It is biting cold, one of those days when the frost makes the snow crunch under the soles of felt boots. A giant of a Red Army man in a helmet fit for the titans of old moves away from a post with the sickle-and-hammer shield and with heavy tread sets out on his beat. He is wearing a grey greatcoat with green tabs on the collar, and felt boots. On top of the greatcoat he has a sheepskin coat reaching down to his heels with a collar of generous proportions to match — a coat that will keep a man warm in the cruellest blizzard. On his head he wears a cloth helmet and his hands are encased in sheepskin mittens. His rifle is slung on his shoulder, and as he proceeds along the sentry path, the tail of his long coat wearing a groove in the snow, he pulls at a cigarette of homegrown tobacco with obvious relish. On open stretches the Soviet border guards are posted a kilometre apart so that each man can always see his neighbour. On the Polish side there are two sentries to the kilometre. 

A Polish infantryman plods along his sentry path toward the Red Army man. He is wearing rough army issue boots, a greenish grey uniform and on top a black coat with two rows of shining buttons. On his head he has the square-topped uniform cap with the white eagle emblem; there are more white eagles on his cloth shoulder straps and the collar tabs, but they do not make him feel any warmer. The frost has chilled him to the marrow, and he rubs his numb ears and knocks his heels together as he walks, while his hands in the thin gloves are stiff with cold. The Pole cannot risk stopping his pacing for a moment, and sometimes he trots, for otherwise the frost would stiffen his joints in a moment. When the two sentries draw together, the zolnierz turns around to walk alongside the Red Army man. 

Conversation on the frontier is forbidden, but when there is no one around within a kilometre — who can tell whether the two are patrolling their sectors in silence or violating international laws. The Pole wants a smoke very badly, but he has forgotten his matches in the barracks, and the breeze wafts over from the Soviet side the tantalising fragrance of tobacco. The Pole stops rubbing his ear and glances back over his shoulder, for who knows when the captain, or maybe Pan the lieutenant, might pop up from behind a knoll with a mounted patrol on one of their eternal inspection rounds. But he sees nothing save the dazzling whiteness of the snow in the sun. In the sky there is not so much as a fleck of a cloud. 

"Got a light, Comrade?" The Pole is the first to violate the sanctity of the law. And shifting his French magazine rifle with the sword bayonet back on his shoulder he laboriously extracts with stiff fingers a packet of cheap cigarettes from the depths of his coat pocket,The Red Army man hears him, but the frontier service regulations forbid conversation across the border. Besides, he could not quite catch what the soldier wanted to say. So he continues on his way, firmly treading down on the crunching snow with his warm, soft felt boots.

"Comrade Bolshevik, got a light? Maybe you'll throw a box of matches across?" This time the Pole speaks Russian.

The Red Army man looks closely at his neighbour. "The frost has nipped the Pan good and proper," he says to himself. "The poor beggar may be a bourgeois soldier but he's got a dog's life.

Imagine being chased out into this cold in that miserable outfit, no wonder he jumps about like a rabbit, and without smoke either." Not turning around, the Red Army man throws a box of matches across to the other. The soldier catches it on the fly, and getting his cigarette going after several unsuccessful attempts, promptly sends the box back across the border.

"Keep it. I've got some more," says the Red frontier guard, forgetting the rules.

From beyond the frontier comes the response:

"Thanks, I'd better not. If they found that box on me I'd get a couple of years in jail."

The Red Army man examines the match box. On the label is an airplane with a sinewy fist instead of a propeller and the word "Ultimatum".

"Right enough, it won't do for them."

The soldier continues to walk, keeping pace with the Red Army man. He does not like to be alone in the midst of this deserted field.

The saddles creaked rhythmically as the horses trotted along at an even, soothing pace, their breath congealing into momentary plumes of white vapour in the frosty air.

A hoary rime stood out around the nostrils of the black stallion. Stepping gracefully, her fine neck arched, the Battalion Commander's dappled mare was playing with her bit. Both horsemen wore army greatcoats belted in at the waist and with three red squares on the sleeves; the only difference was that Battalion Commander Gavrilov's collar tabs were green, while his companion's were red.

Gavrilov was with the Frontier Guards; it was his battalion that manned the frontier posts on this seventy-kilometre stretch, he was the man in charge of this frontier belt. His companion was a visitor from Berezdov — Battalion Commissar Korchagin of the universal military training system.

It had snowed during the night and now the snow lay white and fluffy, untouched by either man or beast. The two men cantered out from the woods and were about to cross an open stretch some forty paces from border posts when Gavrilov suddenly reined in his horse. Korchagin wheeled around to see Gavrilov leaning over from his saddle and inspecting a curious trail in the snow that looked as if someone had been running a tiny cogwheel over the surface. Some cunning little beast had passed here leaving behind the intricate, confusing pattern. It was hard to make out which way the creature had been travelling, but it was not this that caused the Battalion Commander to halt.

Two paces away lay another trail under a powdery sprinkling of snow — the footsteps of a man.There was nothing uncertain about these footprints — they led straight toward the woods, and there was not the slightest doubt that the intruder had come from the Polish side. The Battalion Commander urged on his horse and followed the tracks to the sentry path. The footprints showed distinctly for a dozen paces or so on the Polish side. 

"Somebody crossed the border last night," muttered the Battalion Commander. "The third platoon has been napping again — no mention of it in the morning report!"

Gavrilov's greying moustache silvered by his congealed breath hung grimly over his lip. 

In the distance two figures were approaching — one a slight man garbed in black and with the blade of a French bayonet gleaming in the sun, the other a giant in a yellow sheepskin coat. The dappled mare responded to a jab in her flanks and briskly the two riders bore down on the approaching pair. As they came, the Red Army man hitched up the rifle on his shoulder and spat out the butt of his cigarette into the snow. 

"Hullo, Comrade. How's everything on your sector?" The Battalion Commander stretched out his hand to the Red Army man, who hurriedly removed a mitt to return the handclasp. So tall was the frontier guard that the Commander hardly had to bend forward in his saddle to reach him. 

The Pole looked on from a distance. Here were two Red officers greeting a soldier as they would a close friend. For a moment he pictured himself shaking hands with Major Zakrzewski, but the very thought was so shocking that he glanced furtively over his shoulder. 

"Just look over, Comrade Battalion Commander," reported the Red Army man. 

"Seen the track over there?" 

"No, not yet." 

"Who was on duty here from two to six at night?" 

"Surotenko, Comrade Battalion Commander." 

"All right, but keep your eyes open." 

As the Commander was about to ride on he added a stern word of warning: 

"And you'd better keep away from those fellows." 

"You have to keep your eyes open on the border," the Commander said to his companion as their horses cantered along the broad road leading from the frontier to Berezdov. "The slightest slip can cost you dearly. Can't afford to take a nap on a job like ours. In broad daylight it's not so easy to skip the border, but at night we've got to be on the alert. Now judge for yourself, Comrade Korchagin. On my sector the frontier cuts right through four villages, which complicates things considerably. No matter how close you place your guards you'll find all the relatives from the one side of the line attending every wedding or feast held on the other.

And no wonder — it's only a couple of dozen paces from cottage to cottage and the creek's shallow enough for a chicken to wade across. And there's some smuggling being done, too. True, much of it on a petty scale — an old woman carting across a bottle or two of Polish vodka and that sort of thing. But there is quite a bit of large-scale contraband traffic — people with big money to operate with. Have you heard that the Poles have opened shops in all the border villages where you can get practically everything you want? Those shops aren't intended for their own pauperised peasants, you may be sure." 

As he listened to the Battalion Commander, Korchagin reflected that life on the border must resemble an endless scouting mission. 

"Probably there's something more serious than smuggling going on. What do you say, Comrade Gavrilov?" 

"That's just the trouble," the Battalion Commander replied gloomily.

Berezdov was a small backwoods town that had been within the Jewish pale of residence. It had two or three hundred small houses scattered haphazardly, and a huge market square with a couple of dozen shops in the middle. The square was filthy with manure. Around the town proper were the peasant huts. In the Jewish central section, on the road to the slaughter house, stood an old synagogue — a rickety, depressing building. Although the synagogue still drew crowds on Saturdays, its heyday had gone, and the rabbi lived a life that was by no means to his liking. What happened in 1917 must have been evil indeed if even in this Godforsaken corner the youngsters no longer accorded him the respect due his position. True, the old folk would still eat only kosher food, but how many of the youngsters indulged in the pork sausage which God had cursed. The very thought was revolting! And Rabbi Borukh in a fit of temper kicked viciously at a pig that was assiduously digging in a heap of manure in search of something edible. The rabbi was not at all pleased that Berezdov had been made a district centre, nor did he approve of these Communists who had descended on the place from the devil knows where and were now turning things upside down. Each day brought some fresh unpleasantness. Yesterday, for instance, he had seen a new 

design over the gate of the priest's house: "Berezdov District Committee, Young Communist League of the Ukraine," it had read. 

To expect this sign to augur anything but ill would be useless, mused the rabbi. So engrossed was he in his thoughts that he did not notice the small announcement pasted on the door of his synagogue before he actually bumped into it. 

A public meeting of working youth will be held today at the club. The speakers will be Lisitsyn, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and Korchagin, Acting Secretary of the Komsomol District Committee. After the meeting a concert will be given by the pupils of the nine-year school.

In a fury the rabbi tore down the sheet of paper. The struggle had begun. 

In the centre of a large garden adjoining the local church stood an old house that had once belonged to the priest. A deadly air of boredom filled the musty emptiness of the rooms in which the priest and his wife had lived, two people as old and as dull as the house itself and long bored with one another. The dreariness was swept away as soon as the new masters of the place moved in. The big hall in which the former pious residents had entertained guests only on church holidays was now always full of people, for the house was the headquarters of the Berezdov Communist Party Committee. On the door leading into a small room to the right just inside the front hall the words "Komsomol District Committee" had been written in chalk. Here Korchagin spent part of his working day. Besides being Military Commissar of the Second Universal Military Training Battalion he was also Acting Secretary of the newly-organised Komsomol District Committee. 

Eight months had passed since that gathering at Anna's, yet it seemed that it had been only yesterday. Korchagin pushed the stack of papers aside, and leaning back in his chair gave himself up to his thoughts. ... 

The house was still. It was late at night and the Party Committee office was deserted. Trofimov, the Committee's Secretary, had gone home some time ago, leaving Korchagin alone in the building. Frost had woven a fantastic pattern on the window, but the room was warm. A paraffin lamp was burning on the table. Korchagin recalled the recent past. He remembered how in August the shop Komsomol organisation had sent him as a youth organiser with a repair train to Yekaterinoslav. Until late autumn he had travelled with the train's crew of a hundred and fifty from station to station bringing order into the chaotic aftermath of war, repairing damage and clearing away the remnants of smashed and burnt-out railway carriages. Their route took them from Sinelnikovo to Polog, through country where the bandit Makhno had once operated leaving behind him a trail of wreckage and wanton destruction. In Gulyai-Polye a whole week went into repairing the brick structure of the water tower and patching the sides of the dynamited water tank with iron sheets. Though lacking the skill of a fitter and unaccustomed to the heavy work, Pavel wielded a wrench along with the others and tightened more thousands of rusty bolts than he could remember. 

Late in the autumn the train returned home and the railway shops again were the richer for a hundred and fifty pairs of hands. . . . 

Pavel was now a more frequent visitor at Anna's place. The crease on his forehead smoothed out and his infectious laughter could again be heard. 

Once again the grimy-faced fraternity from the railway shops gathered to hear him talk of bygone years of struggle, of the attempts made by rebellious but enslaved peasant Russia to overthrow the crowned monster that sat heavily on her shoulders, of the insurrections of Stepan Razin and Pugachov. 

One evening at Anna's, when even more young people than usual had gathered there, Pavel announced that he was going to give up smoking, which unhealthy habit he had acquired at an early age. 

"I'm not smoking any more," he declared firmly. 

It all came about unexpectedly. One of the young people present had said that habit — smoking, for instance — was stronger than will power. Opinions were divided. At first Pavel said nothing, but drawn in by Talya, he finally joined the debate. 

"Man governs his habits, and not the other way round. Otherwise what would we get?" 

"Sounds fine, doesn't it?" Tsvetayev put in from his corner. "Korchagin likes to talk big. But why doesn't he apply his wisdom to himself? He smokes, doesn't he? He knows it's a rotten habit. Of course he does. But he isn't man enough to drop it." Then, changing his tone, Tsvetayev went on with a cold sneer: "He was busy 'spreading culture' in the study circles not so long ago. But did this prevent him from using foul language? Anyone who knows Pavel will tell you that he doesn't swear very often, but when he does he certainly lets himself go. It's much easier to lecture others than to be virtuous yourself." 

There was a strained silence. The sharpness of Tsvetayev's tone had laid a chill on the gathering. 

Korchagin did not reply at once. Slowly he removed the cigarette from between his lips and said quietly: 

"I'm not smoking any more." 

Then, after a pause, he added: 

"I'm doing this more for myself than for Dimka. A man who can't break himself of a bad habit isn't worth anything. That leaves only the swearing to be taken care of. I know I haven't quite overcome that shameful habit, but even Dimka admits that he doesn't hear me curse very often. It's harder to stop a foul word from slipping out than to stop smoking, so I can't say at the moment that I've finished with that too. But I will."

Just before the frosts set in, rafts of firewood drifting down the river jammed the channel. Then the autumn floods broke them up and the much-needed fuel was swept away by the rushing waters. And again Solomenka sent its people to the rescue, this time to save the precious wood. 

Unwilling to drop behind the others, Korchagin concealed the fact that he had caught a bad chill until a week later, when the wood had been piled high on shore. The icy water and the chill dankness of autumn had awakened the enemy lurking in his blood and he came down with a high fever. For two weeks acute rheumatism racked his body, and when he returned from hospital, he was able to work at the vice only by straddling the bench. The foreman would look at him and shake his head sadly. A few days later a medical board declared him unfit for work and he was given his discharge pay and papers certifying his right to a pension. This, however, he indignantly refused to accept. 

With a heavy heart he left the shops. He moved about slowly, leaning on his stick, but every step caused excruciating pain. There were several letters from his mother asking him to come home for a visit, and each time he thought of her, her parting words came back to his mind: "I never see you unless you're crippled!" 

At the Gubernia Committee he was handed his Komsomol and Party registration cards and, with as few leave-takings as possible, he left town bound for home. For two weeks his mother steamed and massaged his swollen legs, and a month later to his great joy he was able to walk without the cane. Once again sunlight pierced the gloom. Before long he was back in the gubernia centre; three days there and the Organisational Department sent him to the regional military commissariat to be used as a political worker in a military training unit. 

Another week passed and Pavel arrived in a small snowbound town as Military Commissar assigned to Battalion Two. The Regional Committee of the Komsomol too gave him an assignment: to rally the scattered Komsomol members in the locality and set up a youth league organisation in the district. Thus life got into a new stride.

Outside it was stifling hot. The branch of a cherry-tree peeped in through the open window of the Executive Committee Chairman's office. Across the way the gilded cross atop the gothic belfry of the Polish church blazed in the sun. And in the yard in front of the window tiny downy goslings as green as the grass around — the property of the caretaker of the Executive Committee premises — were busily searching for food. 

The Chairman of the Executive Committee read the dispatch he had just received to the end. A shadow flitted across his face, and a huge gnarled hand strayed into his luxurious crop of hair and paused there. 

Nikolai Nikolayevich Lisitsyn, the Chairman of the Berezdov Executive Committee, was only twenty-four, but none of the members of his staff and the local Party workers would have believed it. A big, strong man, stern and often formidable in appearance, he looked at least thirty-five. He had a powerful physique, a big head firmly planted on a thick neck, piercing brown eyes, and a strong, energetic jaw. He wore blue breeches and a grey tunic, somewhat the worse for wear, with the Order of the Red Banner over the left breast pocket.

Like his father and grandfather before him Lisitsyn had been a metalworker almost from childhood, and before the October Revolution he had "commanded" a lathe at a Tula munitions plant.

Beginning with that autumn night when the Tula gunsmith shouldered a rifle and went out to fight for the workers' power, he had been caught up in the whirlwind of events. The Revolution and the Party sent Lisitsyn from one tight spot to another along a glorious path that witnessed his rise from rank-and-file Red Army man to regimental commander and commissar.

The fire of battle and the thunder of guns had receded into the past. Nikolai Lisitsyn was now working in a frontier district. Life went on at a quiet measured pace, and the Executive Committee Chairman sat in his office until late night after night poring over harvest reports. The dispatch he was now studying, however, momentarily revived the recent past. It was a warning couched in terse telegraphic language:

"Strictly confidential. To Lisitsyn, Chairman of the Berezdov Executive Committee.

"Marked activity has been observed latterly on the border where the Poles have been trying to send across a large band to terrorise the frontier districts. Take precautions. Suggest everything valuable at the Finance Department, including collected taxes, be transferred to area centre."

From his window Lisitsyn could see everyone who entered the District Executive Committee building. Looking up he caught sight of Pavel Korchagin on the steps. A moment later there was a knock on the door.

"Sit down, I've got something to tell you," Lisitsyn said, returning Pavel's handshake.

For a whole hour the two were closeted in the office.

By the time Korchagin emerged from the office it was noon. As he stepped out, Lisitsyn's little sister, Anyutka, a timid child far too serious for her years, ran toward him from the garden. She always had a warm smile for Korchagin and now too she greeted him shyly, tossing a stray lock of her cropped hair back from her forehead.

"Is Kolya busy?" she asked. "Maria Mikhailovna has had his dinner ready for a long time."

"Go right in, Anyutka, he's alone."

Long before dawn the next morning three carts harnessed to well-fed horses pulled up in front of the Executive Committee. The men who came with them exchanged a few words in undertones,and several sealed sacks were then carried out of the Finance Department. These were loaded into the carts and a few minutes later the rumble of wheels receded down the highway. The carts were convoyed by a detail under Korchagin's command. The forty-kilometre journey to the regional centre (twenty-five of them through forests) was made without mishap and the valuables safely deposited in the vaults of the Regional Finance Department.

Some days later a cavalryman galloped into Berezdov from the direction of the frontier. As he passed through the streets he was followed by the wondering stares of the local idlers.

At the gates of the Executive Committee the rider leapt to the ground, and, supporting his sabre with one hand, stamped up the front stairs in his heavy boots. Lisitsyn took the packet with a worried frown. A few minutes later, the messenger was galloping back in the direction whence he had come. 

No one but the Chairman of the Executive Committee knew the contents of the dispatch. But such news had a way of getting round, especially among the local shopkeepers many of whom were smugglers in a small way and had almost an instinct for sensing danger. 

Two men walked briskly along the pavement leading to the headquarters of the Military Training Battalion. One of them was Pavel Korchagin. Him the watchers knew; he always carried a gun. 

But the fact that his companion, the Party Committee Secretary Trofimov, had strapped on a revolver looked ominous. 

Several minutes later a dozen men ran out of the headquarters carrying rifles with bayonets fixed and marched briskly to the mill standing at the crossroads. The rest of the local Communist Party and Komsomol members were being issued arms at the Party Committee offices. The Chairman of the Executive Committee galloped past, wearing a Cossack cap and the customary Mauser. 

Something was obviously afoot. The main square and sidestreets grew deserted. Not a soul was in sight. In a flash huge medieval padlocks appeared on the doors of the tiny shops and shutters boarded windows. Only the fearless hens and hogs continued to rummage among piles of refuse. 

The pickets took cover in the gardens at the edge of the town where they had a good view of the open fields and the straight road reaching into the distance. 

The dispatch received by Lisitsyn had been brief: 

"A mounted band of about one hundred men with two light machine-guns broke through to Soviet territory after a fight in the area of Poddubtsy last night. Take precautionary measures. The trail of the band has been lost in the Slavuta woods. A Red Cossack company has been sent in pursuit of the band. The company will pass through Berezdov during the day. Do not mistake them for the enemy. Gavrilov, Commander, Detached Frontier Battalion.

No more than an hour had passed when a rider appeared on the road leading to the town, followed by a group of horsemen moving about a kilometre behind. Korchagin's keen eyes followed their movements. The lone rider was a young Red Army man from the Seventh Red Cossack Regiment, a novice at reconnaissance, and hence, though he picked his way cautiously enough, he failed to spot the pickets ambushed in the roadside gardens. Before he knew it he was surrounded by armed men who poured onto the road from the greenery, and when he saw the Komsomol emblem on their tunics, he smiled sheepishly. After a brief confab, he turned his horse around and galloped back to the mounted force now coming up at a trot. The pickets let the Red Cossacks through and resumed their watch in the gardens. 

Several anxious days passed before Lisitsyn received word that the raid had failed. Pursued by the Red cavalry, the riders had had to beat a hasty retreat across the frontier. 

A handful of Bolsheviks, numbering nineteen in all, applied themselves energetically to the job of building up Soviet life in the district. This was a new dministrative unit and hence everything had to be created from bottom up. Besides, the proximity of the border called for unflagging vigilance. 

Lisitsyn, Trofimov, Korchagin and the small group of active workers they had rallied toiled from dawn till dusk arranging for re-elections of Soviets, fighting the bandits, organising cultural work, putting down smuggling, in addition to Party and Komsomol work to strengthen defence.

From saddle to desk, and from desk to the common where squads of young military trainees diligently drilled, then the club and the school and two or three committee meetings — such was the daily round of the Military Commissar of Battalion Two. Often enough his nights were spent on horseback, Mauser at his side, nights whose stillness was broken by a sharp "Halt, who goes there?" and the pounding of the wheels of a fleeing cart laden with smuggled goods from beyond the border. 

The Berezdov District Committee of the Komsomol consisted of Korchagin, Lida Polevykh, a girl from the Volga who headed the Women's Department, and Zhenka Razvalikhin, a tall, handsome young man who had been a Gymnasium student only a short time before. Razvalikhin had a weakness for thrilling adventures and was an authority on Sherlock Holmes and Louis Boussenard. Previously he had been office manager for the District Committee of the Party, and though he had joined the Komsomol only four months before, posed as an "old Bolshevik". 

Someone was needed in Berezdov to take charge of political education work, and since there was no one else to send, the Regional Committee, after some hesitation, had chosen Razvalikhin.

The sun had reached its zenith. The heat penetrated everywhere and all living creatures sought refuge in the shade. Even the dogs crawled under sheds and lay there panting, inert and sleepy. 

The only sign of life in the village was a hog revelling in a puddle of mud next to the well. Korchagin untethered his horse, and biting his lip from the pain in his knee, climbed into the saddle. The teacher was standing on the steps of the schoolhouse shading her eyes from the sun with the palm of her hand. 

"I hope to see you soon again, Comrade Military Commissar," she smiled. 

The horse stamped impatiently, stretched its neck and pulled at the reins. 

"Good-bye, Comrade Rakitina. So it's settled: you'll give the first lesson tomorrow." 

Feeling the pressure of the bit relax, the horse was off at a brisk trot. Suddenly wild cries reached Pavel's ears. It sounded like the shrieking of women when villages catch fire. Wheeling his mount sharply around, the Military Commissar saw a young peasant woman running breathlessly into the village. Rakitina rushed forward and stopped her. From the nearby cottages the inhabitants looked out, mostly old men and women, for all the able-bodied peasants were working in the fields. 

"0-o-oh! Good people! Come quickly! Come quickly! They're a-murdering each other over there!" 

When Korchagin galloped up people were crowding around the woman, pulling at her white blouse and showering her with anxious questions, but they could make nothing of her incoherent cries. "It's murder! They're cutting them up..." was all she could say. An old man with a tousled beard came up, supporting his homespun trousers with one hand as he ran. 

"Stop your noise," he shouted at the hysterical woman. "Who's being murdered? What's it all about? Stop your squealing, damn you!" 

"It's our men and the Poddubtsy crowd . . . fighting over the boundaries again. They're slaughtering our men!" 

That told them all. Women wailed and the old men bellowed in fury. The news swept through the village and eddied in the backyards: "The Poddubtsy crowd are cutting up our fellows with scythes.... It's those boundaries again!" Only the bedridden remained indoors, all the rest poured into the village street and arming themselves with pitchforks, axes or sticks pulled from wattle fences ran toward the fields where the two villages were engaged in their bloody annual contest over the boundaries between their fields. 

Korchagin struck his horse and the animal was off at a gallop. The animal flew past the running village folk and, ears pressed back and hooves furiously pounding the around, steadily increased its breakneck pace. On a hillock a windmill spread out its arms as if to bar the way. To the right, by the river bank, were the low meadows, and to the left a rye field rose and dipped all the way to the horizon. The wind rippled the ears of the ripe grain. Poppies sprinkled the roadside with bright red. It was quiet here, and unbearably hot. But from the distance, where the silvery ribbon of the river basked in the sun, came the cries of battle. 

The horse continued its wild career down toward the meadows. "If he stumbles, it's the end of both of us," flashed in Pavel's mind. But there was no stopping now, and all he could do was to listen to the wind whistle in his ears as he bent low in the saddle. 

Like a whirlwind he galloped into the field where the bloody combat was raging. Several already lay bleeding on the ground. 

The horse ran down a bearded peasant armed with the stub of a scythe handle who was pursuing a young man with blood streaming down his face. Nearby a sunburned giant of a man was aiming vicious kicks with his big heavy boots at the solar plexus of his victim. 

Charging into the mass of struggling men at full speed, Korchagin sent them flying in all directions. Before they could recover from the surprise, he whirled madly now upon one, now on another, realising that he could disperse this knot of brutalised humanity only by terrorising them. 

"Scatter, you swine!" he shouted in a fury. "Or I'll shoot every last man of you, you blasted bandits!" 

And pulling out his Mauser he fired over an upturned face twisted with savage rage. Again the horse whirled around and again the Mauser spoke. Some of the combatants dropped their scythes and turned back. Dashing up and down the field and firing incessantly, the Commissar finally got the situation in hand. The peasants took to their heels and scattered in all directions anxious to escape both from responsibility for the bloody brawl and from this man on horseback so terrible in his fury who was shooting without stop. 

Luckily no one was killed and the wounded recovered. Nevertheless soon afterward a session of the district court was held in Poddubtsy to hear the case, but all the judge's efforts to discover the ringleaders were unavailing. With the persistence and patience of the true Bolshevik, the judge sought to make the sullen peasants before him see how barbarous their actions had been, and to impress upon them that such violence would not be tolerated. 

"It's the boundaries that are to blame, Comrade judge," they said. "They've a way of getting mixed up — every year we fight over them." 

Nevertheless some of the peasants had to answer for the fight. 

A week later a commission came to the hay lands in question and began staking out the disputed strips. 

"I've been working as land surveyor for nearly thirty years, and always it's been the dividing lines that caused trouble," the old surveyor with the commission said to Korchagin as he rolled up his tape. The old man was sweating profusely from the heat and the exertion. "Ljooking at the way the meadows are divided you'd hardly believe your eyes. A drunkard could draw straighter lines. And the fields are even worse. Strips three paces wide and one crossing into the other — to try and separate them is enough to drive you mad. And they're being cut up more and more what with sons growing up and fathers splitting up their land with them. Believe me, twenty years from now there won't be any land left to till, it'll all be balks. As it is, ten per cent of the land is being wasted in this way."

Korchagin smiled.

"Twenty years from now we won't have a single balk left, Comrade surveyor."

The old man gave him an indulgent look.

"The communist society, you mean? Well, now, that's pretty much in the future, isn't it?"

"Have you heard about the Budanovka Collective Farm?"

"Yes. I've been in Budanovka. But that's the exception, Comrade Korchagin."

The commission went on measuring strips of land. Two young men hammered in stakes. And on both sides stood the peasants watching closely to make sure that they went down where the half-rotten sticks barely visible in the grass marked the previous dividing lines.

Whipping up his wretched nag, the garrulous driver turned to his passengers.

"Where all these Komsomol lads have sprung up from beats me!" he said. "Don't remember anything like it before. It's that schoolteacher woman who's started it, for sure. Rakitina's her name, maybe you know her? She's a young wench, but she's a troublemaker. Stirs up all the womenfolk in the village, puts all kinds of silly ideas into their heads and that's how the trouble begins. It's got so a man can't beat his wife any more! In the old days you'd give the old woman a clout whenever you felt out of sorts and she'd slink away and sulk, but now she kicks up such a row you wished you hadn't touched her. She'll threaten you with the People's Court, and as for the younger ones, they'll talk about divorce and reel off all the laws to you. Look at my Ganka, she quietest wench you ever saw, now she's gone and got herself made a delegate; the elder among the womenfolk, I think that means. The women come to her from all over the village. I nearly let her have a taste of the whip when I heard about it, but I spat on the whole business. They can go to the devil! Let them jabber. She isn't a bad wench when it comes to housework and such things."

The driver scratched his hairy chest visible through the opening in his homespun shirt and flicked his whip under the horse's belly. The two in the cart were Razvalikhin and Lida. They both had business in Poddubtsy. Lida planned to call a conference of women's delegates, and Razvalikhin had been sent to help the local cell organise its work.

"So you don't like the Komsomols?" Lida jokingly asked the driver.

He plucked at his little beard for a while before replying.

"Oh I don't mind them.... I believe in letting the youngsters enjoy themselves, putting on plays and such like. I'm fond of a comedy myself if it's good. We did think at the beginning the young folk would get out of hand, but it turned out just the opposite. I've heard folks say they're very strict about drinking and rowing and such like. They go in more for book learning. But they won't leave God be, and they're always trying to take the church away and use it for a club. Now that's no good, it's turned the old folks against them. But on the whole they're not so bad. If you ask me,though, they make a big mistake taking in all the down-and-outs in the village, the ones who hire out, or who can't make a go of their farms. They won't have anything to do with the rich peasants'sons."

The cart clattered down the hill and pulled up outside the school building.

The caretaker had put up the new arrivals and gone off to sleep in the hay. Lida and Razvalikhin had just returned from a meeting which had ended rather late. It was dark inside the cottage. Lida undressed quickly, climbed into bed and fell asleep almost at once. She was rudely awakened by Razvalikhin's hands travelling over her in a manner that left no doubt as to his intentions.

"What do you want?"

"Shush, Lida, don't make so much noise. I'm sick of lying there all by myself. Can't you find anything more exciting to do than snooze?"

"Stop pawing me and get off my bed at once!" Lida said, pushing him away. Razvalikhin's oily smile had always sickened her and she wanted to say something insulting and humiliating, but sleep overpowered her and she closed her eyes.

"Aw, come on! You weren't brought up in a nunnery by any chance? Stop playing the little innocent, you can't fool me. If you were really an advanced woman, you'd satisfy my desire and then go to sleep as much as you want."

Considering the matter settled, he went over and sat on the edge of the bed again, laying a possessive hand on her shoulder.

"Go to hell!" Lida was now wide awake. "I'm going to tell Korchagin about this tomorrow."

Razvalikhin seized her hand and whispered testily: "I don't care a damn about your Korchagin,and you'd better not try to resist or I'll take you by force."

There was a brief scuffle and then two resounding slaps rang out. Razvalikhin leapt aside. Lida groped her way to the door, pushed it open and rushed out into the yard.

She stood there in the moonlight, panting with fury and disgust.

"Get inside, you fool!" Razvalikhin called to her viciously.

He carried his own bed out under the shed and spent the rest of the night there. Lida fastened the door on the latch, curled up on the bed and went to sleep again.

In the morning they set out for home. Razvalikhin sat gloomily beside the old driver smoking one cigarette after another.

"That touch-me-not may really go and spill the beans to Korchagin, blast her!" he was thinking.

"Who'd have thought she'd turn out to be such a prig? You'd think she was a raving beauty by the way she acts, but she's nothing to look at. But I'd better make it up with her or there may be trouble. Korchagin has his eye on me as it is."

He moved over to Lida. He pretended to be ashamed of himself, put on a downcast air and mumbled a few words of apology.

That did the trick. Before they had reached the edge of the village Lida had given him her promise not to tell anyone what had happened that night.

Komsomol cells sprang up one after another in the border villages. The District Committee members carefully tended these first young shoots of the Communist movement.

Korchagin and Lida Polevykh spent much time in the various localities working with the local Komsomol members.

Razvalikhin did not like making trips to the countryside. He did not know how to win the confidence of the peasant lads and only succeeded in bungling things. Lida and Pavel, on the other hand, had no difficulty in making friends with the peasant youth. The girls took to Lida at once, they accepted her as one of themselves and gradually she awakened their interest in the Komsomol movement. As for Korchagin, all the young folk in the district knew him. One thousand six hundred of the young men due to be called up for military service went through preliminary training in his battalion. Never before had his accordion played such an important role in propaganda as here in the village. The instrument made Pavel tremendously popular with the young folk, who gathered of an evening on the village lane to enjoy themselves, and for many a towheaded youngster the road to the Komsomol began here as he listened to the enchanting music of the accordion, now passionate and stirring, now strident and brave, now tender and caressing as only the sad, wistful songs of the Ukraine can be. They listened to the accordion, and they listened to the young man who played it, a railway worker who was now Military Commissar and Komsomol secretary. And the music of the accordion seemed to mingle harmoniously with what the young Commissar told them. Soon new songs rang out in the villages, and new books appeared in the cottages beside the prayer-books and Bibles. 

The smugglers now had more than the frontier guards to reckon with; in the Komsomol members the Soviet Government had acquired staunch friends and zealous assistants.

Sometimes the Komsomol cells in the border towns allowed themselves to be carried away by their enthusiasm in hunting down enemies and then Korchagin would have to come to the aid of his young comrades. 

Once Grishutka Khorovodko, the blue-eyed Secretary of the Poddubtsy cell, a hot-headed lad fond of an argument and very active in the anti-religious movement, learned from private sources of information that some smuggled goods were to be brought that night to the village mill. He roused all the Komsomol members and, armed with a training rifle and two bayonets, they set out at the dead of night, quietly laid an ambush at the mill and waited for their quarry to appear. The border post, which had been informed of the smugglers' move, sent out a detail of its own. In the dark the two sides met and clashed, and had it not been for the vigilance displayed by the frontier guards, the young men might have suffered heavy casualties in the skirmish. As it was the youngsters were merely disarmed, taken to a village four kilometres away and locked up. Korchagin happened to be at Gavrilov's place at the time. When the Battalion Commander told him the news the following morning, Pavel mounted his horse and galloped off to rescue his boys. The frontier man in charge laughed as he told him the story. 

"I'll tell you what we'll do, Comrade Korchagin," he said. "They're fine lads and we shan't make trouble for them. But you had better give them a good talking to so that they won't try to do our work for us in the future." 

The sentry opened the door of the shed and the eleven lads got up and stood sheepishly shifting their weight from one foot to the other. 

"Look at them," the frontier man said with studied severity. "They've gone and made a mess of things, and now I'll have to send them on to area headquarters." 

Then Grishutka spoke up. 

"But Comrade Sakharov," he said agitatedly, "what crime have we committed? We've had our eye on that kulak for a long time. We only wanted to help the Soviet authorities, and you go and lock us up like bandits." He turned away with an injured air. 

After a solemn consultation, during which Korchagin and Sakharov had difficulty in preserving their gravity, they decided the boys had had enough of a fright.

"If you will vouch for them and promise us that they won't go taking walks over to the frontier any more I'll let them go," Sakharov said to Pavel. "They can help us in other ways."

"Very well, I'll vouch for them. I hope they won't let me down any more."

The youngsters marched back to Poddubtsy singing. The incident was hushed up. And it was not long before the miller was caught, this time by the law.

In the Maidan-Villa woods there lived a colony of rich German farmers. The kulak farms stood within half a kilometre of each other, as sturdily built as miniature fortresses. It was from Maidan-Villa that Antonyuk and his band operated. Antonyuk, a one-time tsarist army sergeant major, had recruited a band of seven cutthroats from among his kith and kin and, armed with pistols, staged hold-ups on the country roads. He did not hesitate to spill blood, he was not averse to robbing wealthy speculators, but neither did he stop at molesting Soviet workers. Speed was Antonyuk's watchword. One day he would rob a couple of co-operative store clerks and the next day he would disarm a postal employee in a village a good twenty kilometres away, stealing everything the man had on him, down to the last kopek. Antonyuk competed with his fellow-brigand Gordei, one was worse than the other, and between them the two kept the area militia and frontier guard authorities very busy. Antonyuk operated just outside Berezdov, and it grew dangerous to appear on the roads leading to the town. The bandit eluded capture; when things grew too hot for him he would withdraw beyond the border and lie low only to turn up again when he was least expected. His very elusiveness made him a menace. Every report of some fresh outrage committed by this brigand caused Lisitsyn to gnaw his lips with rage.

"When will that rattlesnake stop biting us? He'd better take care, the scoundrel, or I'll have to settle his hash myself," he would mutter through clenched teeth. Twice the District Executive Chairman,taking Korchagin and three other Communists with him, set out hot on the bandit's trail, but each time Antonyuk got away.

A special detachment was sent to Berezdov from the area centre to fight the bandits. It was commanded by a dapper youth named Filatov. Instead of reporting to the Chairman of the Executive Committee, as frontier regulations demanded, this conceited youngster went straight to the nearest village, Semaki, and arriving at the dead of night, put up with his men in a house on the outskirts. The mysterious arrival of these armed men was observed by a Komsomol member living next door who hurried off at once to report to the Chairman of the Village Soviet. The latter,knowing nothing about the detachment, took them for bandits and dispatched the lad at once to the district centre for help. Filatov's foolhardiness very nearly cost many lives. Lisitsyn roused the militia in the middle of the night and hurried off with a dozen men to tackle the "bandits" in Semaki. They galloped up to the house, dismounted and climbing over the fence closed in on the house. The sentry on duty at the door was knocked down by a blow on the head with a revolver-butt, Lisitsyn broke in the door with his shoulder and he and his men rushed into a room dimly lighted by an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling. With a grenade in one hand and his Mauser in the other Lisitsyn roared so that the window panes rattled:

"Surrender, or I'll blow you to bits!"

Another second and the sleepy men leaping to their feet from the floor might have been cut down by a hail of bullets. But the sight of the man with the grenade poised for the throw was so awe inspiring that they put up their hands. A few minutes later, when the "bandits" were herded outside in their underwear, Filatov noticed the decoration on Lisitsyn's tunic and hastened to explain. 

Lisitsyn was furious. "You fool!" he spat out with withering contempt.

Tidings of the German revolution, dim echoes of the rifle fire on the Hamburg barricades reached the border area. An atmosphere of tension hung over the frontier.

Newspapers were read with eager expectation. The wind of revolution blew from the West. Applications poured in to the Komsomol District Committee from Komsomols volunteering for service in the Red Army. 

Korchagin was kept busy explaining to the youngsters from the cells that the Soviet Union was pursuing a policy of peace and that it had no intentions of going to war with its neighbours. But this had little effect. Every Sunday Komsomol members from the entire district held meetings in the big garden of the priest's house, and one day at noon the Poddubtsy cell turned up in proper marching order in the yard of the District Committee. Korchagin saw them through the window and went out into the porch. Eleven lads, with Khorovodko at their head, all wearing top boots, and with large canvas knapsacks on their backs, halted at the entrance. 

"What's this, Grisha?" Korchagin asked in surprise. 

Instead of replying, Khorovodko signed to Pavel with his eyes and went inside the building with him. Lida, Razvalikhin and two other Komsomol members pressed around the newcomer demanding an explanation. Khorovodko closed the door and wrinkling his bleached eyebrows announced: 

"This is a sort of test mobilisation, Comrades. My own idea. I told the boys this morning a telegram had come from the district, strictly confidential of course, that we're going to war with the German bourgeoisie, and we'll soon be fighting the Polish Pany as well. All Komsomols are called up, on orders from Moscow, I told them.

Anyone who's scared can file an application and he'll be allowed to stay home. I ordered them not to say a word about the war to anyone, just to take a loaf of bread and a hunk of fatback apiece, and those who didn't have any fatback could bring garlic or onions. We were to meet secretly outside the village and go to the district centre and from there to the area centre where arms would be issued. You ought to see what an effect that had on the boys! They tried hard to pump me, but I told them to get busy and cut out the questions. Those who wanted to stay behind should say so. We only wanted volunteers. Well, my boys dispersed and I began to get properly worried. Supposing nobody turned up? If that happened I would disband the whole cell and move to some other place. I sat there outside the village waiting with my heart in my boots. After a while they began coming, one by one. Some of them had been crying, you could see by their faces, though they tried to hide it. All ten of them turned up, not a single deserter. That's our Poddubtsy cell for you!" he wound up triumphantly. 

When the shocked Lida Polevykh began to scold him, he stared at her in amazement. 

"What do you mean? This is the best way to test them, I tell you. You can see right through each one of them. There's no fraud there. I was going to drag them to the area centre just to keep up appearances, but the poor beggars are dog-tired. You'll have to make a little speech to them, Korchagin. You will, won't you? It wouldn't be right without a speech. Tell them the mobilisation has been called off or something, but say that we're proud of them just the same."

Korchagin seldom visited the area centre, for the journey took several days and pressure of work demanded his constant presence in the district. Razvalikhin, on the other hand, was ready to ride off to town on any pretext. He would set out on the journey armed from head to foot, fancying himself one of Fenimore Cooper's heroes. As he drove through the woods he would take pot shots at crows or at some fleetfooted squirrel, stop lone passersby and question them sternly as to who they were, where they had come from and whither they were bound. On approaching the town he would remove his weapons, stick his rifle under the hay in the cart and, hiding his revolver in his pocket, stroll into the office of the Komsomol Regional Committee looking his usual self. 

"Well, what's the news in Berezdov?" Fedotov, Secretary of the Regional Committee, inquired as Razvalikhin entered his office one day. 

Fedotov's office was always crowded with people all talking at once. It was not easy to work under such conditions, listening to four different people, while replying to a fifth and writing something at the same time. Although Fedotov was very young he had been a Party member since 1919; it was only in those stormy times that a 15-year-old lad could have been admitted into the Party. "Oh, there's plenty of news," answered Razvalikhin nonchalantly. "Too much to tell all at once. It's one long grind from morning till night. There's so much to attend to. We've had to start from the very beginning, you know. I set up two new cells. Now, tell me what you called me here for?" And he sat down in an armchair with a businesslike air. 

Krymsky, the head of the economic department, looked up from the heap of papers on his desk for a moment. 

"We asked for Korchagin, not you," he said. Razvalikhin blew out a thick cloud of tobacco smoke. 

"Korchagin doesn't like coming here, so I have to do it on top of everything else.... In general, some secretaries have a fine time of it. They don't do anything themselves. It's the donkeys like me who have to carry the load. Whenever Korchagin goes to the border he's gone for two or three weeks and all the work is left to me." 

Razvalikhin's broad hint that he was the better man for the job of district secretary was not lost on his hearers. 

"That fellow doesn't appeal to me much," Fedotov remarked to the others when Razvalikhin had gone. 

Razvalikhin's trickery was exposed quite by chance. Lisitsyn dropped into Fedotov's office one day to pick up the mail, which was the custom for anyone coming from the district, and in the course of a conversation between the two men Razvalikhin was exposed. 

"Send Korchagin to us anyway," said Fedotov in parting. "We hardly know him here." 

"Very well. But don't try to take him away from us, mind. We shan't allow that."

This year the anniversary of the October Revolution was celebrated on the border with even greater enthusiasm than usual. Korchagin was elected chairman of the committee organising the celebrations in the border villages. After the meeting in Poddubtsy, five thousand peasants from three neighbouring villages marched to the frontier in a procession half a kilometre long, carrying scarlet banners and with a military band and the training battalion at the head. They marched in perfect order on the Soviet side of the frontier, parallel to the border posts, bound for the villages that had been cut in two by the demarcation line. Never before had the Poles witnessed the like on their frontier. Battalion Commander Gavrilov and Korchagin rode ahead of the column on horseback, and behind them the band played, the banners rustled in the breeze and the singing of the people resounded far and wide. The peasant youth clad in their holiday best were in high spirits, the village girls twittered and laughed gaily, the adults marched along gravely, the old folk with an air of solemn triumph. The human stream stretched as far as eye could see. One of its banks was the frontier, but no one so much as stepped across that forbidden line. Korchagin watched the sea of people march past. The strains of the Komsomol song "From the forests dense to Britain's seas, the Red Army is strongest of all!" gave way to a girls' chorus singing "Up on yonder hillide the girls are a-mowing...." 

The Soviet sentries greeted the procession with happy smiles. The Polish guards looked on bewildered. This demonstration on the frontier caused no little consternation on the other side, although the Polish command had been warned of it in advance. Mounted gendarme patrols moved restlessly back and forth, the frontier guard had been strengthened fivefold and reserves were hidden behind the nearby hills ready for any emergency. But the procession kept to its own territory, marching along gaily, filling the air with its singing. 

A Polish sentry stood on a knoll. The column approached with measured tread. The first notes of a march rang out. The Pole brought his rifle smartly to his side and then presented arms, and Korchagin distinctly heard the words: "Long live the Commune!" 

The soldier's eyes told Pavel that it was he who had uttered the words. Pavel stared at him fascinated. 

A friend! Beneath the soldier's uniform a heart beat in sympathy with the demonstrators. Pavel replied softly in Polish: 

"Greetings, Comrade!" 

The sentry stood in the same position while the demonstration marched past. Pavel turned round several times to look at the dark little figure. Here was another Pole.

His whiskers were touched with grey and the eyes under the shiny peak of his cap expressed nothing. Pavel, still under the impression of what he had just heard, murmured in Polish as if to himself: 

"Greetings, Comrade!" 

But there was no reply. 

Gavrilov smiled. He had overheard what had passed. 

"You expect too much," he observed. "They aren't all plain infantrymen, you know. Some of them are gendarmes. Didn't you notice the chevron on his sleeve? That one was a gendarme for sure." 

The head of the column was already descending the hill toward a village cut in two by the frontier. The Soviet half of the village had prepared to meet the guests in grand style. All the inhabitants were waiting at the frontier bridge on the bank of the stream. The young folk were lined up on either side of the road. The roofs of cottages and sheds on the Polish side were covered with people who were watching the proceedings on the opposite bank with tense interest. There were crowds of peasants on the cottage steps and by the garden fences. When the procession entered the human corridor the band struck up the Internationale. Later stirring speeches were delivered from a platform decorated with greenery. Young men and white-headed veterans addressed the crowd. 

Korchagin too spoke in his native Ukrainian. His words flew over the border and were heard on the other side of the river, whereupon the gendarmes over there began to disperse the villagers for fear that those fiery words might inflame the hearts of those who listened. Whips whistled and shots were fired into the air. 

The streets emptied out. The young folk, scared off the roofs by gendarme bullets, disappeared. 

Those on the Soviet side looked on and their faces grew grave. Filled with wrath by what he had just witnessed, an aged shepherd climbed onto the platform with the help of some village lads and addressed the crowd in great agitation. 

"You've seen, my children? That's how we used to be treated too. But no more. Nobody dare whip us peasants any more. We've finished with the gentry and their whippings.

We're in power now and it's for you, my sons, to hold on firmly to that power. I'm an old man and I'm not much good at speech-making. But I'd tell you a lot if I could.

I'd tell you how we used to toil like oxen in the days of the tsars. That's why it hurts to see those poor folks over there." He pointed with a shaking hand toward the other side of the river, and fell to weeping as old men do. 

Then Grishutka Khorovodko spoke. Gavrilov, listening to his wrathful speech, turned his horse around and scanned the opposite bank to see whether anyone there was taking notes. But the river bank was deserted. Even the sentry by the bridge had been removed. 

"Well, it looks as if there won't be any protest note to the Foreign Affairs Commissariat after all," he laughed.

One rainy night in late autumn the bloody trail of Antonyuk and his seven men came to an end. 

The bandits were caught at a wedding party in the house of a wealthy farmer in the German colony in Maidan-Villa. It was the peasants from the Khrolinsky Commune who tracked him down. 

The local women had spread the news about these guests at the colony wedding, and the Komsomols got together at once, twelve of them, and armed with whatever they could lay their hands on, set out for Maidan-Villa by cart, sending a messenger post-haste to Berezdov. At Semaki the messenger chanced to meet Filatov's detachment, which rushed off hot on the trail. 

The Khrolinsky men surrounded the farm and began to exchange rifle fire with the Antonyuk band. The latter entrenched themselves in a small wing of the farmhouse and opened fire at anyone who came within range. They tried to make a dash for it, but were driven back inside the building after losing one of their number. Antonyuk had been in many a tight corner like this and had fought his way out with the aid of hand grenades and darkness. He might have escaped this time too, for the Khrolinsky Komsomols had already lost two men, but Filatov arrived in the nick of time. Antonyuk saw that the game was up. He continued firing back till morning from all the windows, but at dawn they took him. Not one of the seven surrendered. It cost four lives to stamp out the viper's nest. Three of the casualties were lads from the newly-organised Khrolinsky Komsomol group. 

Korchagin's battalion was called up for the autumn manoeuvres of the territorial forces. The battalion covered the forty kilometres to the divisional camp in a single day's march under a driving rain. They set out early in the morning and reached their destination late at night. Gusev, the Battalion Commander, and his commissar rode on horseback. The eight hundred trainees reached the barracks exhausted and went to sleep at once. The manoeuvres were due to begin the followin

Part Two Chapter 5
---

The tramcar crawled laboriously up Fundukleyevskaya Street, its motors groaning with the effort. At the Opera House it stopped and a group of young people alighted. The car continued the climb.

"We'd better get a move on," Pankratov urged the others, "or we'll be late for sure."

Okunev caught up with him at the theatre entrance.

"We came here under similar circumstances three years ago, you remember, Genka? That was when Dubava came back to us with the 'Workers' Opposition'. A grand meeting!

And tonight

we've got to grapple with him again!"

They had presented their passes and been admitted into the hall before Pankratov replied:

"Yes, history is repeating itself on the very same spot."

They were hissed to silence. The evening session of the conference had already begun and they had to take the first seats they could find. A young woman was addressing the gathering from the rostrum. It was Talya.

"We're just in time. Now sit quiet and listen to what wifie has to say," Pankratov whispered,giving Okunev a dig in the ribs.

". . .It's true that we have spent much time and energy on this discussion, but I think that we have all learned a great deal from it. Today we are very glad to note that in our organisation Trotsky's followers have been defeated. They cannot complain that they were not given a hearing. On the contrary: they have had every opportunity to express their point of view. As a matter of fact they have abused the freedom we gave them and committed a number of gross violations of Party discipline."

Talya was nervous; you could tell by the way she kept tossing back a lock of hair that fell forward over her eyes as she spoke.

"Many comrades from the districts have spoken here, and they have all had something to say about the methods the Trotskyites have been using. There are quite a number of Trotskyites at this conference. The districts deliberately sent them here to give us another opportunity to hear them out at this city Party conference. It is not our fault if they are not making full use of this opportunity. Evidently their complete defeat in the districts and cells has taught them something.

They could hardly get up at this conference and repeat what they were saying only yesterday."

A harsh voice from the right-hand corner of the hall interrupted Talya at this point:

"We haven't had our say yet!"

Talya turned in the direction of the voice:

"All right, Dubava, come up here now and speak, we'll listen to you."

Dubava stared gloomily back at her and his lips twisted in anger.

"We'll talk when the time comes!" he shouted back. He thought of the crushing defeat he had sustained the day before in his own district. The memory still rankled.

A low murmur passed over the hall. Pankratov, unable to restrain himself, cried out:

"Going to try shaking up the Party again, eh?"

Dubava recognised the voice, but did not turn round. He merely dug his teeth into his lower lip and bent his head.

"Dubava himself offers a striking example of how the Trotskyites are violating Party discipline,"

Talya went on. "He has worked in the Komsomol for a long time, many of us know him, the arsenal workers in particular. He is a student of the Kharkov Communist University, yet we all know that he has been here with Shumsky for the past three weeks. What has brought them here in the middle of the university term? There isn't a single district in town where they haven't addressed meetings. True, during the past few days Shumsky has shown signs of coming to his senses. Who sent them here?

Besides them, there are a good number of other Trotskyites from various organisations. They all worked here before at one time or another and now they have come back to stir up trouble within the Party. Do their Party organisations know where they are? Of course not." 

The conference was expecting the Trotskyites to come forward and admit their mistakes. Talya, hoping to persuade them to take this step, appealed to them earnestly. She addressed herself directly to them as if in comradely, informal debate: 

"Three years ago in this very theatre Dubava came back to us with the former 'Workers' Opposition'. Remember? And do you remember what he said then: 'Never shall we let the Party banner fall from our hands.' But hardly three years have passed and Dubava has done just that. 

Yes, I repeat, he has let the Party banner fall. 'We haven't had our say yet!' he just said. That shows that he and his fellow Trotskyites intend to go still further." 

"Let Tufta tell us about the barometer," came a voice from the back rows. "He's their weather expert." 

To which indignant voices responded: 

"This is no time for silly jokes!" 

"Are they going to stop fighting the Party or not? Let them answer that!" 

"Let them tell us who wrote that anti-Party declaration!" 

Indignation rose higher and higher and the chairman rang his bell long and insistently for silence. 

Talya's voice was drowned out by the din, and it was some time before she was able to continue. 

"The letters we receive from our comrades in the outlying localities show that they are with us in this and that is very encouraging. Permit me to read part of one letter we have received. It is from Olga Yureneva. Many of you here know her. She is in charge of the Organisational Department of an Area Committee of the Komsomol." 

Talya drew a sheet of paper out of a pile before her, ran her eye over it and began: 

"All practical work has been neglected. For the past four days all bureau members have been out in the districts where the Trotskyites have launched a more vicious campaign than ever. An incident occurred yesterday which aroused the indignation of the entire organisation. Failing to get a majority in a single cell in town, the opposition decided to rally their forces and put up a fight in the cell of the Regional Military Commissariat, which also includes the Communists working in the Regional Planning Commission and Educational Department. The cell has forty-two members, but all the Trotskyites banded together there. Never had we heard such anti-Party speeches as were made at that meeting. One of the Military Commissariat members got up and said outright: 'If the Party apparatus doesn't give in, we will smash it by force.' The oppositionists applauded that statement. Then Korchagin took the floor. 'How can you applaud that fascist and call yourselves Party members?' he said, but they raised such a commotion, shouting and banging their chairs, that he could not go on. The members who were disgusted by this outrageous behaviour demanded that Korchagin be given a hearing, but the uproar was repeated as soon as he tried to make himself heard. 'So this is what you call democracy!' he shouted above the din. 'I'm going to speak just the same!' At that point several of them fell on him and tried to drag him off the platform. There was wild confusion. Pavel fought back and went on speaking, but they dragged him off the stage, opened. a side door and threw him onto the stairway, his face was bleeding. After that, nearly all the members left the meeting. That incident was an eye-opener for many. ..."

Talya left the platform.

Segal, who had been in charge of the Agitation and Propaganda Department of the Gubernia Party Committee for two months now, sat in the presidium next to Tokarev and listened attentively to the speeches of the delegates. So far the conference had been addressed exclusively by young people who were still in the Komsomol.

"How they have matured these past few years!" Segal was thinking.

"The opposition is already getting it hot," he remarked to Tokarev, "and the heavy artillery has not yet been brought into action. It's the youth who are routing the Trotskyites." Just then Tufta leapt onto the platform. He was met by a loud buzz of disapproval and a brief outburst of laughter. Tufta turned to the presidium to protest against his reception, but the hall had already quieted down.

"Someone here called me a weather expert. So that is how you mock at my political views,Comrades of the majority!" he burst out in one breath.

A roar of laughter greeted his words. Tufta appealed indignantly to the chairman:

"You can laugh, but I tell you once again, the youth is a barometer. Lenin has said so time and again."

In an instant silence reigned in the hall.

"What did Lenin say?" came voices from the audience.

Tufta livened up.

"When preparations were being made for the October uprising Lenin issued instructions to muster the resolute working-class youth, arm them and send them together with the sailors to the most important sectors. Do you want me to read you that passage? I have all the quotations down on cards." Tufta dug into his portfolio.

"Never mind, we know it!"

"But what did Lenin say about unity?"

"And about Party discipline?"

"When did Lenin ever set up the youth in opposition to the old guard?"

Tufta lost the thread of his thoughts and switched over to another theme:

"Lagutina here read a letter from Yureneva. We cannot be expected to answer for certain excesses that might occur in the course of debate."

Tsvetayev, sitting next to Shumsky, hissed in fury: "Fools barge in. . . ."

"Yes," Shumsky whispered back. "That idiot will ruin us completely."

Tufta's shrill, high-pitched voice continued to grate on the ears of his hearers:

"If you have organised a majority faction, we have the right to organise a minority faction."

A commotion arose in the hall.

Angry cries rained down on Tufta from all sides:

"What's that? Again Bolsheviks and Mensheviks!"

"The Russian Communist Party isn't a parliament!"

"They're working for all sorts of factionists, from Myasnikov to Martov!"

Tufta threw up his arms as if about to plunge into a river, and returned an excited rapid-fire:

"Yes, we must have freedom to form groups. Otherwise how can we who hold different views fight for our opinions against such an organised, well-disciplined majority?"

The uproar increased. Pankratov got up and shouted:

"Let him speak. We might as well hear what he has to say. Tufta may blurt out what the others prefer to keep to themselves."

The hall quieted down. Tufta realised that he had gone too far. Perhaps he ought not to have said that now. His thoughts went off at a tangent and he wound up his speech in a rush of words:

"Of course you can expel us and shove us overboard. That sort of thing is beginning already.

You've already got me out of the Gubernia Committee of the Komsomol. But never mind, we'll soon see who was right." And with that he jumped off the stage into the hall.

Tsvetayev passed a note down to Dubava. "Mityai, you take the floor next. Of course it won't alter the situation, we are obviously getting the worst of it here. We must put Tufta right. He's a blockhead and a gas-bag."

Dubava asked for the floor and his request was granted immediately.

An expectant hush fell over the hall as he mounted the platform. It was the usual silence that precedes a speech, but to Dubava it was pregnant with hostility. The ardour with which he had addressed the cell meetings had cooled off by now. From day to day his passion had waned, and after the crushing defeat and the stern rebuff from his former comrades, it was like a fire doused with water, and now he was enveloped by the bitter smoke of wounded vanity made bitterer still by his stubborn refusal to admit himself in the wrong. He resolved to plunge straight in although he knew that he would only be alienating himself still further from the majority. His voice when he spoke was toneless, yet distinct.

"Please do not interrupt me or annoy me by heckling. I want to set forth our position in full,although I know in advance that it is no use. You have the majority."

When at last he finished speaking it was as if a bombshell had burst in the hall. A hurricane of angry shouts descended upon him, stinging him like whiplashes.

"Shame!"

"Down with the splitters!"

"Enough mud-slinging!"

To the accompaniment of mocking laughter Dubava went back to his seat, and that laughter cut like a knife-thrust. Had they stormed and railed at him he would have been gratified, but to be jeered at like a third-rate actor whose voice had cracked on a false note was too much.

"Shumsky has the floor," announced the chairman.

Shumsky got up. "I decline to speak."

Then Pankratov's bass boomed from the back rows.

"Let me speak!"

Dubava could tell by his voice that Pankratov was seething inwardly. His deep voice always boomed thus when he was mortally insulted, and a deep uneasiness seized Dubava as he gloomily watched the tall, slightly bent figure stride swiftly over to the platform. He knew what Pankratov was going to say. He thought of the meeting he had had the day before with his old friends at Solomenka and how they had pleaded with him to break with the opposition. Tsvetayev and Shumsky had been with him. They had met at Tokarev's place. Pankratov, Okunev, Talya,Volyntsev, Zelenova, Staroverov and Artyukhin had been present. Dubava had remained deaf to this attempt to restore unity. In the middle of the discussion he had walked out with Tsvetayev,thus emphasising his unwillingness to admit his mistakes. Shumsky had remained. And now he had refused to take the floor. "Spineless intellectual! Of course they've won him over," Dubava thought with bitter resentment. He was losing all his friends in this frenzied struggle. At the university there had been a rupture in his friendship with Zharky, who had sharply censured the declaration of the "forty-six" at a meeting of the Party bureau. And later, when the clash grew sharper, he had ceased to be on speaking terms. Several times after that Zharky had come to his place to visit Anna. It was a year since Dubava and Anna had been married. They occupied separate rooms, and Dubava believed that his strained relations with Anna, who did not share his views, had been aggravated by Zharky's frequent visits. It was not jealousy on his part, he assured himself, but under the circumstances her friendship with Zharky irritated him. He had spoken to Anna about it and the result had been a scene which had by no means improved their relations. He had left for the conference without telling her where he was going. 

The swift flight of his thoughts was cut short by Pankratov. 

"Comrades!" the word rang out as the speaker took up a position at the very edge of the platform. "Comrades! For nine days we have listened to the speeches of the opposition, and I must say quite frankly that they spoke here not as fellow fighters, revolutionaries, our comrades in the class struggle. Their speeches were hostile, implacable, malicious and slanderous. Yes, Comrades, slanderous! They have tried to represent us Bolsheviks as supporters of a mailed-fist regime in the Party, as people who are betraying the interests of their class and the Revolution. They have attempted to brand as Party bureaucrats the best, the most tried and trusty section of our Party, the glorious old guard of Bolsheviks, men who built up the Russian Communist Party, men who suffered in tsarist prisons, men who with Comrade Lenin at their head have waged a relentless struggle against world Menshevism and Trotsky. Could anyone but an enemy make such statements? Is the Party and its functionaries not one single whole? Then what is this all about, I want to know? What would we say of men who would try to incite young Red Army men against their commanders and commissars, against army headquarters — and at a time when the unit was surrounded by the enemy? According to the Trotskyites, so long as I am a mechanic I'm 'all right', but if tomorrow I should become the secretary of a Party Committee I would be a 'bureaucrat' and a 'chairwarmer'! Isn't it a bit strange, Comrades, that among the oppositionists who are fighting against bureaucracy and for democracy there should be men like Tufta, for example, who was recently removed from his job for being a bureaucrat? Or Tsvetayev, who is well known to the Solomenka folks for his 'democracy'; or Afanasyev, who was taken off the job three times by the Gubernia Committee for his highhanded way of running things in Podolsk District? It turns out that all those whom the Party has punished have united to fight the Party. Let the old Bolsheviks tell us about Trotsky's 'Bolshevism'. It is very important for the youth to know the history of Trotsky's struggle against the Bolsheviks, about his constant shifting from one camp to another. 

The struggle against the opposition has welded our ranks and it has strengthened the youth ideologically. The Bolshevik Party and the Komsomol have become steeled in the fight against petty-bourgeois trends. The hysterical panic-mongers of the opposition are predicting complete economic and political collapse. Our tomorrow will show how much these prophecies are worth. 

They are demanding that we send old Bolsheviks like Tokarev, for instance, back to the bench and replace him by some weather-vane like Dubava who imagines his struggle against the Party to be a sort of heroic feat. No, Comrades, we won't agree to that. The old Bolsheviks will get replacement, but not from among those who violently attack the Party line whenever we are up against some difficulty. We shall not permit the unity of our great Party to be disrupted. Never will the old and young guard be split. Under the banner of Lenin, in unrelenting struggle against petty-bourgeois trends, we shall march to victory!"

Pankratov descended the platform amid thunderous applause.

The following day a group of ten met at Tufta's place.

"Shumsky and I are leaving today for Kharkov," Dubava said. "There is nothing more for us to do here. You must try to keep together. All we can do now is to wait and see what happens. It is obvious that the All-Russia Conference will condemn us, but it seems to me that it is too soon to expect any repressive measures to be taken against us. The majority has decided to give us another chance. To carry on the struggle openly now, especially after the conference, means getting kicked out of the Party, and that does not enter into our plans. It is hard to say what the future holds for us. I think that's all there is to be said." Dubava got up to go.

The gaunt, thin-lipped Staroverov also rose.

"I don't understand you, Mityai," he said, rolling his r's and slightly stammering. "Does that mean that the conference decision is not binding on us?"

"Formally, it is," Tsvetayev cut him short. "Otherwise you'll lose your Party card. But we'll wait and see which way the wind blows and in the meantime we'll disperse."

Tufta stirred uneasily in his chair. Shumsky, pale and downcast, with dark circles under his eyes,sat by the window biting his nails. At Tsvetayev's words he abandoned his depressing occupation and turned to the meeting.

"I'm opposed to such manoeuvres," he said in sudden anger. "I personally consider that the decision of the conference is binding on us. We have fought for our convictions, but now we must submit to the decision that has been taken."

Staroverov looked at him with approval.

"That is what I wanted to say," he lisped.

Dubava fixed Shumsky with his eyes and said with a sneer:

"Nobody's suggesting that you do anything. You still have a chance to 'repent' at the Gubernia Conference."

Shumsky leapt to his feet.

"I resent your tone, Dmitri! And to be quite frank, what you say disgusts me and forces me to reconsider my position."

Dubava waved him away.

"That's exactly what I thought you'd do. Run along and repent before it is too late." With that Dubava shook hands with Tufta and the others and left. Shumsky and Staroverov followed soon after.

Cruel cold marked the advent in history of the year one thousand nine hundred and twenty-four.

January fastened its icy grip on the snowbound land, and from the second half of the month howling storms and blizzards raged.

The Southwestern Railway was snowed up. Men fought the maddened elements. The steel screws of snowploughs cut into the drifts, clearing a path for the trains. Telegraph wires weighted down with ice snapped under the impact of frost and blizzard, and of the twelve lines only three functioned — the Indo-European and two government lines. 

In the telegraph office at Shepetovka station three apparatuses continued their unceasing chatter understandable only to the trained ear. 

The girl operators were new at the job; the length of the tape they had tapped out would not have exceeded twenty kilometres, but the old telegrapher who worked beside them had already passed the two-hundred-kilometre mark. Unlike his younger colleagues he did not need to read the tape in order to make out the message, nor did he puzzle with wrinkled brow over difficult words or phrases. Instead he wrote down the words one after the other as the apparatus ticked them out. 

Now his ear caught the words "To all, to all, to all!" 

"Must be another of those circulars about clearing away the snow," the old telegrapher thought to himself as he wrote down the words. Outside, the blizzard raged, hurling the snow against the window. The telegrapher thought someone was knocking at the window, his eyes strayed in the direction of the sound and for a moment were arrested by the intricate pattern the frost had traced on the panes. No engraver could ever match that exquisite leaf-and-stalk design! 

His thoughts wandered and for a while he stopped listening to the telegraph. But presently he looked down and reached for the tape to read the words he had missed. 

The telegraph had tapped out these words: 

"At 6.50 in the afternoon of January 21. . .." Quickly writing down the words, the telegrapher dropped the tape and resting his head on his hand returned to listening. 

"Yesterday in Gorki the death occurred...." Slowly he put the letters down on paper. How many messages had he taken down in his long life, joyous messages as well as tragic ones, how often had he been the first to hear of the sorrows or happiness of others! He had long since ceased to ponder over the meaning of the terse, clipped phrases, he merely caught the sounds and mechanically set them down on paper. 

Now too someone had died, and someone was being notified of the fact. The telegrapher had forgotten the initial words: "To all, to all, to all." The apparatus clicked out the letters "V-1-a-d-im-i-r I-1-y-i-c-h ', and the old telegrapher translated the hammer taps into words. He sat there unperturbed, a trifle weary. Someone named Vladimir Ilyich had died somewhere, someone would receive the message with the tragic tidings, a cry of grief and anguish would be wrung from someone, but it was no concern of his, for he was only a chance witness. The apparatus tapped out a dot, a dash, more dots, another dash, and out of the familiar sounds he caught the first letter and set it down on the telegraph form. It was the letter "L". Then came the second letter, "E"; next to it he inscribed a neat "N", drawing a heavy slanting line between the two uprights, hastily added an "I" and absently picked up the last letter — "N". 

The apparatus tapped out a pause, and for the fraction of a second the telegrapher's eye rested on the word he had written: "LENIN". 

The apparatus went on tapping, but the familiar name now pierced the telegrapher's consciousness. 

He glanced once more at the last words of the message — "LENIN". What? Lenin? The entire text of the telegram flashed before his mind's eye. He stared at the telegraph form, and for the first time in all his thirty-two years of work he could not believe what he had written. 

He ran his eye swiftly thrice over the lines, but the words obstinately refused to change: "the death occurred of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin." The old man leapt to his feet, snatched up the spiral of tape and bored it with his eyes. The two-metre strip confirmed that which he refused to believe! He turned a deathlike face to his fellow workers, and his frightened cry fell on their ears: "Lenin is dead!"

The terrible news slipped through the wide open door of the telegraph office and with the speed of a hurricane swept over the station and into the blizzard, whipped over the tracks and switches and along with the icy blast tore through the ironbound gates of the railway shops. 

A current repair crew was busy overhauling an engine standing over the first pit. Old Polentovsky himself had crawled down under the belly of his engine and was pointing out the ailing spots to the mechanics. Zakhar Bruzzhak and Artem were straightening out the bent bars of the fire grate. 

Zakhar held the grating on the anvil and Artem wielded the hammer. 

Zakhar had aged. The past few years had left a deep furrow on his forehead and touched his temples with silver. His back was bent and there were shadows in his sunken eyes. 

The figure of a man was silhouetted for a moment in the doorway, and then the evening shadows swallowed him up. The blows of the hammer on iron drowned out his first cry, but when he reached the men working at the engine Artem paused with his hammer poised to strike. 

"Comrades! Lenin is dead!" 

The hammer slid slowly from Artem's shoulder and his hands lowered it noiselessly onto the concrete floor. 

"What's that? What did you say?" Artem's hand clutched convulsively at the sheepskin of the man who had brought the fearful tidings. 

And he, gasping for breath, covered with snow, repeated in a low, broken voice: 

"Yes, Comrades, Lenin is dead." 

And because the man did not shout, Artem realised that the terrible news was true. Only now did he recognise the man — it was the secretary of the local Party organisation. 

Men climbed out of the pit and heard in silence of the death of the man with whose name the whole world had rung. 

Somewhere outside the gates an engine shrieked, sending a shudder through the group of men. 

The anguished sound was echoed by another engine at the far side of the station, then by a third. 

Their mighty chorus was joined by the siren of the power station, high-pitched and piercing like the flight of shrapnel. Then all was drowned out by the deep sonorous voice of the handsome engine of the passenger train about to leave for Kiev. 

A GPU agent started in surprise when the driver of the Polish engine of the Shepetovka-Warsaw express, on learning the reason for the alarming whistles, listened for a moment, then slowly raised his hand and pulled at the whistle cord. He knew that this was the last time he would do so, that he would never be allowed to drive this train again, but his hand did not let go of the cord, and the shriek of his engine roused the startled Polish couriers and diplomats from their soft couches. 

People crowded into the railway shops. They poured through all the gates and when the vast building was filled to overflowing the funeral meeting opened amid heavy silence. The old Bolshevik Sharabrin, Secretary of the Shepetovka Regional Committee of the Party, addressed the gathering. 

"Comrades! Lenin, the leader of the world proletariat, is dead. The Party has suffered an irreparable loss, for the man who created the Bolshevik Party and taught it to be implacable to its enemies is no more.... The death of the leader of our Party and our class is a summons to the best sons of the proletariat to join our ranks...."

The strains of the funeral march rang out, the men bared their heads, and Artem, who had not wept for fifteen years, felt a lump rising in his throat and his powerful shoulders shook.The very walls of the railwaymen's club seemed to groan under the pressure of the human mass.

Outside it was bitterly cold, the two tall fir-trees at the entrance to the hall were garbed in snow and icicles, but inside it was suffocating from the heated stoves and the breath of six hundred people who had gathered to the memorial meeting arranged by the Party organisation.

The usual hum of conversation was stilled. Overpowering grief muffled men's voices and they spoke in whispers, and there was sorrow and anxiety in the eyes of many.

They were like the crew of a ship that had lost her helmsman in a storm.

Silently the members of the bureau took their seats on the platform. The stocky Sirotenko carefully lifted the bell, rang it gently and replaced it on the table. This was enough for an oppressive hush to settle over the hall.

When the main speech had been delivered, Sirotenko, the Secretary of the Party organisation, rose to speak. And although the announcement he made was unusual for a memorial meeting, it surprised no one.

"A number of workers," he said, "have asked this meeting to consider an application for membership in the Party. The application is signed by thirty-seven comrades."

And he read out the application:

"To the railway organisation of the Bolshevik Party at Shepetovka Station, Southwestern Railway.

"The death of our leader is a summons to us to join the ranks of the Bolsheviks, and we ask that this meeting judge of our worthiness to join the Party of Lenin."

Two columns of signatures were affixed to this brief statement.

Sirotenko read them aloud, pausing a few seconds after each name to allow the meeting to memorise them.

"Stanislav Zigmundovich Polentovsky, engine driver, thirty-six years of service."

A murmur of approval rippled over the hall.

"Artem Andreyevich Korchagin, mechanic, seventeen years of service."

"Zakhar Filippovich Bruzzhak, engine driver, twenty-one years of service."

The murmur increased in volume as the man on the platform continued to call out the names of veteran members of the horny-palmed fraternity of railwaymen.

Silence again reigned when Polentovsky, whose name headed the list, stood before the meeting.

The old engine driver could not but betray his agitation as he told the story of his life.

". . . What can I tell you, Comrades? You all know what the life of a workingman was like in the old days. Worked like a slave all my life and remained a beggar in my old age. When the Revolution came, I confess I considered myself an old man burdened down by family cares, and I did not see my way into the Party. And although I never sided with the enemy I rarely took part in the struggle myself. In nineteen hundred and five I was a member of the strike committee in the Warsaw railway shops and I was on the side of the Bolsheviks. I was young then and full of fight. 

But what's the use of recalling the past! Ilyich's death has struck right at my heart; we've lost our friend and champion, and it's the last time I'll ever speak about being old. I don't know how to put it, for I never was much good at speech making. But let me say this: my road is the Bolsheviks' road and no other." 

The engine driver tossed his grey head and his eyes under his white brows looked out steadily and resolutely at the audience as if awaiting its decisive words. 

Not a single voice was raised in opposition to the little grey-haired man's application, and no one abstained during the voting in which the non-Party people too were invited to take part. 

Polentovsky walked away from the presidium table a member of the Communist Party. 

Everyone was conscious that something momentous was taking place. Now Artem's great bulk loomed where the engine driver had just stood. The mechanic did not know what to do with his hands, and he nervously gripped his shaggy fur cap. His sheepskin jacket, threadbare at the edges, was open, but the high-necked collar of his grey army tunic was fastened on two brass buttons lending his whole figure a holiday neatness. Artem turned to face the hall and caught a fleeting glimpse of a familiar woman's face. It was Galina, the stonemason's daughter, sitting with her workmates from the tailor shop. She was gazing at him with a forgiving smile, and in that smile he read approval and something he could not have put into words. 

"Tell them about yourself, Artem!" he heard Sirotenko say. 

But it was not easy for Artem to begin his tale. He was not accustomed to addressing such a large audience, and he suddenly felt that to express all that life had stored within him was beyond his powers. He fumbled painfully for words, and his nervousness made it all the harder for him. Never had he experienced the like. He felt that this was a vital turning point for him, that he was about to take a step that would bring warmth and meaning into his harsh, warped life. 

"There were four of us," Artem began. 

The hall was hushed. Six hundred people listened eagerly to this tall worker with the beaked nose and the eyes hidden under the dark fringe of eyebrows. 

"My mother worked as cook for the rich folk. I hardly remember my father; he and mother didn't get along. He drank too much. So mother had to take care of us kids. It was hard for her with so many mouths to feed. She slaved from morning till night and got four rubles a month and her grub. I was lucky enough to get two winters of school. They taught me to read and write, but when I turned nine my mother had to send me to work as an apprentice in a machine shop. I worked for three years for nothing but my grub. . .. The shop owner was a German named Foerster. He didn't want to take me at first, said I was too young. But I was a sturdy lad, and my mother added on a couple of years. I worked three years for that German, but instead of learning a trade I had to do odd jobs around the house, and run for vodka. The boss drank like a fish. . . . He'd send me to fetch coal and iron too.. . . The mistress made a regular slave out of me: I had to peel potatoes and scour pots. I was always getting kicked and cuffed, most times for no reason, just out of habit. If I didn't please the mistress — and she was always on the rampage on account of her husband's drinking — she would beat me. I'd run away from her out into the street, but where could I go, who was there to complain to? My mother was forty miles away, and she couldn't keep me anyway.... And in the shop it wasn't any better. The master's brother was in charge, a swine of a man who used to enjoy playing tricks on me. 'Here boy,' he'd say, 'fetch me that washer from over there,' and he'd point to the corner by the forge. I'd run over and grab the washer and let out a yell. 

It had just come out of the forge; and though it looked black lying there on the ground, when you touched it, it burned right through the flesh. I'd stand there screaming with the pain and he'd burst his sides laughing. I couldn't stand any more of this and I ran away home to mother. But she didn't know what to do with me, so she brought me back. She cried all the way there, I remember. In my third year they began to teach me something about the trade, but the beatings continued. I ran away again, this time to Starokonstantinov. I found work in a sausage factory and wasted more than a year and a half washing casings. Then our boss gambled away his factory, didn't pay us a kopek for four months and disappeared. I got out of that hole, took a train to Zhmerinka and went to look for work. I was lucky enough to meet a railwayman there who took pity on me. When I told him I was a mechanic of sorts, he took me to his boss and said I was his nephew and asked him to find some work for me. By my size they took me for seventeen, and so I got a job as a mechanic's helper. As for my present job, I've been working here for more than eight years. That is all I can tell you about my past. You all know about my present life here." 

Artem wiped his brow with his cap and heaved a deep sigh. He had not yet said the chief thing. 

This was the hardest thing of all to say, but he had to say it before anyone asked the inevitable question. And knitting his bushy eyebrows, he went on with his story: 

"Why did I not join the Bolsheviks before? That is a question you all have the right to ask me. 

How can I answer? After all, I'm not an old man yet. How is it I didn't find the road here until today? I'll tell you straight, for I've nothing to hide. I missed that road, I ought to have taken it back in nineteen eighteen when we rose against the Germans. Zhukhrai, the sailor, told me so many a time. It wasn't until 1920 that I took up a rifle. When the storm was over and we had driven the Whites into the Black Sea, we came back home. Then came the family, children. ... I got all tied up in family life. But now that our Comrade Lenin is gone and the Party has issued its call, I have looked back at my life and seen what was lacking. It's not enough to defend your own power, we have to stick together like one big family, in Lenin's place, so that the Soviet power should stand solid like a mountain of steel. We must become Bolsheviks. It's our Party, isn't it?" 

When he finished, a little abashed at having made such a long speech, he felt as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders, and, pulling himself up to his full height, he stood waiting for the questions to come. 

"Any questions?" Sirotenko's voice broke the ensuing silence. 

A stir ran over the gathering, but no one responded at first to the chairman's call. Then a stoker, straight from his engine and black as a beetle, said with finality: 

"What's there to ask? Don't we know him? Vote him in and be done with it!" 

Gilyaka, the smith, his face scarlet from the heat and the excitement, cried out hoarsely: 

"This comrade's the right sort, he won't jump the rails, you can depend on him. Vote him, Sirotenko!" 

At the very back of the hall where the Komsomols were sitting, someone, invisible in the semidarkness, rose and said: 

"Let Comrade Korchagin explain why he has settled on the land and how he reconciles his peasant status with his proletarian psychology." 

A light rustle of disapproval passed over the hall and a voice rose in protest:

"Why don't you talk so us plain folks can understand? A fine time to show off...."

But Artem was already replying:

"That's all right, Comrade. The lad is right about my having settled on the land. That's true, but I haven’t betrayed my working-class conscience. Anyhow, that's over and done with from today.

I'm moving my family closer to the sheds. It's better here. That cursed bit of land has been sticking in my throat for a long time."

Once again Artem's heart trembled when he saw the forest of hands raised in his favour, and with head held high he walked back to his seat. Behind him he heard Sirotenko announce:

"Unanimous."

The third to take his place at the presidium table was Zakhar Bruzzhak, Polentovsky's former helper. The taciturn old man had been an engine driver himself now for some time. When he finished his account of a lifetime of labour and brought his story up to the present, his voice dropped and he spoke softly but loud enough for all to hear:

"It is my duty to finish what my children began. They wouldn't have wanted me to hide away in a corner with my grief. That isn't what they died for. I haven't tried to fill the gap left by their death,but now the death of our leader has opened my eyes. Don't ask me to answer for the past. From today our life starts anew."

Zakhar's face clouded and looked stern as painful memories stirred within him. But when a sea of hands swept up, voting for his acceptance into the Party, his eyes lit up and his greying head was no longer bowed.

Far into the night continued this review of the new Party replacements. Only the best were admitted, those whom everyone knew well, whose lives were without blemish.

The death of Lenin brought many thousands of workers into the Bolshevik Party. The leader was gone but the Party's ranks were unshaken. A tree that has thrust its mighty roots deep into the ground does not perish if its crown is severed.

　　电车沿丰杜克列耶夫大街吃力地向上爬行，马达一个劲地呜呜叫着。它开到歌剧院门前，停了下来，一群青年下了车，它又继续向上爬去。

　　潘克拉托夫不住地催促落在后面的人：“快走吧，同志们。咱们肯定要迟到了。”

　　奥库涅夫到歌剧院门口才赶上他，说：“你记得吧，伊格纳特，三年前咱们也是这样来开会的。

　　那时候，柯察金、杜巴瓦和一群‘工人反对派’回到咱们队伍里来了。那天晚上的会开得真好。今天咱们又要跟杜巴瓦斗一斗了。”

　　他们向站在门口的检查小组出示了证件，走进了会场。这时，潘克拉托夫才回答说：“是呀，杜巴瓦的这出戏又要旧地重演了。”

　　有人嘘了一声，要他们保持肃静。他们只好就近找位子坐下。晚上的会议已经开始。在台上发言的是一位女同志。

　　“来得正是时候。快听听你老婆说些什么。”潘克拉托夫用胳膊肘捅了一下奥库涅夫，悄悄地说。

　　“……不错，进行这场辩论，我们花费了不少时间和精力，但是，青年们参加辩论，学到了很多东西。我们可以非常满意地指出这样一个事实，就是在我们的组织里，托洛茨基信徒们的失败已经成为定局。我们给了他们发言的机会，让他们充分说明他们的观点。在这方面，他们是没有什么可抱怨的。恰恰相反，他们甚至滥用了我们给他们的行动自由，干了一连串严重破坏党纪的事情。”

　　塔莉亚非常激动，一绺头发垂到脸上，妨碍她说话。她把头向后一甩，继续说：“各区来的许多同志在这儿发了言，他们都谈到了托洛茨基分子采用的种种手段。出席这次大会的托洛茨基派的代表相当多嘛。各区特意发给他们代表证，好让大家在这次市党代会上再听听他们的意见。他们发言不多，那不能怪我们。他们在各区和各支部都遭到了彻底的失败，多少学乖了一点，他们很难再跑上这个讲台，把那些老调重弹一遍。”

　　突然，会场右角有个人刺耳地喊了一声，打断了塔莉亚的发言：“我们还是要说话的。”

　　塔莉亚转身对那个人说：“好吧，杜巴瓦，那就请上来说吧，我们倒要听听。”

　　杜巴瓦恼恨地看着她，神经质地撇了撇嘴。

　　“到时候自然会说！”他喊了一句，立刻想起他昨天在索洛缅卡区的惨败，那个区里的人都知道他。

　　会场上发出一阵不满的嗡嗡声。潘克拉托夫忍不住喊了起来：“怎么，你们还想动摇我们的党吗？”

　　杜巴瓦听出了他的声音，但是连头也没有回，只是用力咬住嘴唇，低下了头。

　　塔莉亚继续说：“就拿杜巴瓦来说吧，他正是托洛茨基分子破坏党纪的一个突出的典型。他做了很长时间的共青团工作，许多人都认识他，兵工厂的人更了解他。杜巴瓦现在是哈尔科夫共产主义大学的学生，可是，我们大家知道，他跟米海拉·什科连科在这儿已经呆了三个星期。这时候大学里功课正紧张，他们跑到这儿来干什么呢？全市没有一个区他们没有去讲演过。

　　不错，最近什科连科开始醒悟了。谁派他们到这儿来的？除了他们两个以外，我们这儿还有许多外地来的托洛茨基分子。

　　他们以前都在这儿工作过，现在回来就是为了在党内煽风点火。他们所在的党组织知不知道他们现在在什么地方呢？当然不知道。”

　　台下传来了舒姆斯基的喊声：“我们没办法，都在灌木丛里打小工，我们没有地方办公。”

　　会场上响起了一阵哄笑，舒姆斯基自己也笑了。

　　舒姆斯基的玩笑暂时缓和了会场上的紧张气氛。大家都在等待托洛茨基分子出来发言，承认自己的错误。不管怎么说，这些同志虽然凶恶地反对多数派，他们同出席市党代会的这四百名代表过去毕竟共过患难，只不过由于不肯悬崖勒马，反而猛烈攻击党和共青团的领导，这种共同性才日渐消失，到前来参加会议的时候，压倒的多数派和分裂的少数派已经势不两立了。然而，只要杜巴瓦、舒姆斯基和他们那伙人真心诚意悔过自新，那么，言归于好仍然是可能的。可惜的是，这件事没有发生。

　　塔莉亚还在动脑筋，要说服他们承认错误。她说：“同志们，大家该还记得，三年前，也是在这个剧场里，杜巴瓦同志和一批‘工人反对派’的成员回到了咱们的队伍里。当时，柯察金发了言，这个发言同时也是受杜巴瓦同志委托做的，发言中说：‘党的旗帜永远不会从我们手中掉下去。’大家还记得吧？但是，不到三年，杜巴瓦同志已经把党的旗帜抛弃了。他刚才说：‘我们还是要说话的。’这说明，他和他的同伙还要继续顽抗下去。

　　“我回过头来讲一讲杜巴瓦在佩乔拉区代表会议上的发言。他都说了些什么，我念念速记记录：“年轻人不得担任党的领导职务。党委会到处都是由上面指派的，党的机关已经僵化，变成了官僚。一切迹象表明，老干部已经蜕化了。党的领导工作只能由这些职业管理人员来担任成了法规，这种合法的特权必须打破。我们要给党机关的日益衰老的机体注入新鲜的血液，年轻的血液。但是，党机关在疯狂地捍卫自己掌权的权利。为什么管理机关要拼命攻击托洛茨基同志呢？因为正是他勇敢地说出了这样的话：青年是党的晴雨表。”

　　会场上的喧闹声更大了。后排有人喊道：“让图夫塔谈谈晴雨表吧，他是他们的气象学家。”

　　会场上发出激烈的喊声：“别开玩笑！”

　　“让他们回答：他们还搞不搞反党活动了？”

　　“让他们交代，那篇反党宣言是谁写的？”

　　大家的情绪越来越激昂，执行主席不住地摇铃。

　　会场上人声嘈杂，淹没了塔莉亚的声音。不过，这场风暴很快就过去了，又可以听到她的讲话：“托洛茨基分子抱怨说，他们受到了无情的斥责。那他们要什么礼遇呢？最近几年，党和共青团思想上已经成长起来，坚强起来。党的绝大多数青年积极分子以刺刀来迎接托洛茨基分子的挑战，我们只能为此而感到骄傲。当辩论深入到广大党团员群众中去之后，托洛茨基分子输得就更惨了。他们到处煽风点火，夸夸其谈，可基层干部并不上他们的当。杜巴瓦和舒姆斯基同志有很多朋友，可朋友们也不支持他们，这并不是我们的过错。

　　“一九二一年舒姆斯基曾和我们一起同杜巴瓦斗争。如今他们同流合污了。茨韦塔耶夫过去就参加过‘工人反对派’，现在他继续同我们作对。斯塔罗韦罗夫摇摆不定，一会儿向东，一会儿向西。斗争使我们受到了锻炼。青年们思想上成长起来。

　　“我还想说一点。我们经常收到各地同志们的来信，表示支持我们，这使我们深受鼓舞。我们是一个家庭的成员，损失哪一个同志对我们来说都是痛心的。现在，请允许我读一段来信给大家听听。信是奥莉加·尤列涅娃写来的。在座的人很多都认识她。她现在是共青团专区委员会的组织部长。”

　　塔莉亚从一沓信纸里抽出一张来，很快看了一遍，就读起来：日常工作停顿了，四天来所有的常委都下到各区去了。托洛茨基分子挑起了一场空前激烈的斗争。昨天发生的事引起了全专区党员的极大愤慨。反对派在市里任何一个支部都没有得到多数人的支持，于是就决定集中力量，在专区军务部的党支部里大干一场。这个支部包括专区计划部和工人教育部的党员，总共四十二个人，托洛茨基分子全都集中到了这里，参加这个支部的会议，并且发表了前所未闻的恶毒的反党言论。军务部有一个人竟公然宣称：“过去我们追随托洛茨基进行了国内战争。现在如果需要，我们准备接着打下去。为了健全机体，有时就得动外科手术。如果党的机关不投降，我们就用武力摧毁它。”

　　反对派听了这样的话，居然还鼓掌。这时，保尔站了起来，发表了义正词严的讲话。我没法把他的话全部转述出来。

　　他揭露了胆敢在工人阶级政党头顶上挥舞马刀的反对派的真实嘴脸，斥责反对派说：“你们作为布尔什维克党的成员，怎么能给这样一个法西斯分子鼓掌喝彩呢？”

　　这帮人马上鼓噪起来，把椅子敲得乒乓乱响，不让保尔说下去，还不断叫骂：“机关老爷！官僚！共青团贵族！”

　　支部的有些成员，见到会场上涌进来那么多“外人”，非常生气，他们要求让保尔把话说完，可保尔刚一开口，这帮人又都起哄。

　　保尔冲他们喊道：“瞧你们的民主，真是绝妙的写照。不管你们怎么闹，我还是要说下去，哪怕是为了那些中托洛茨基的毒还不太深的人也要说。”

　　这时候，上来好几个人，抓住保尔，使劲往台下拽。他们干脆撒起野来了。保尔一边挣扎，一边继续往下讲。那些人把他拖到后台，打开旁门，扔了出去。有一个坏蛋还把他的脸打出血来。那个支部的党员几乎全都退场了。这件事擦亮了许多人的眼睛，他们退出了反对派……

　　塔莉亚放下拿着信纸的手，又激动地说下去：“我们谢加连区的党团员听到保尔站在我们一边，非常高兴。”

　　会场上一时间又响起了混杂在一起的喊声，只有几句能听清楚：“他们争取民主靠的是拳头。”

　　“让他们说说，他们到底什么目的。”

　　塔莉亚的发言时间已到，她走下了讲台。

　　下面还有人要发言。台上的主席团有十五个成员，其中有托卡列夫和谢加尔。

　　谢加尔到省党委担任宣传鼓动部部长的职务已经两个月了。他仔细听着市党代会各位代表的发言，到现在为止，发言的还全是年轻代表。

　　“三年前还都是些‘共青娃娃’呢，是又细又瘦的嫩枝条。

　　这三年他们成长得多快呀。”谢加尔轻声对身旁几位年纪大的人说。

　　“看到反对派竭力破坏新老近卫军的团结，却遇到如此多的困难，心里真是舒坦，而我们的重炮还没有投入战斗呢。”

　　托卡列夫听到谢加尔又在诙谐地说。

　　这时图夫塔连蹦带跳跑上了主席台，会场上对他发出一阵不满的喧嚷和短暂的哄笑。图夫塔转向主席团，想就此提出抗议，但是会场已经安静下来了。

　　“刚才有人管我叫气象学家。多数派同志们，你们就是这样讥笑我的政治观点吗？”他一口气说了出来。

　　一阵哄堂大笑盖住了他的声音。图夫塔气愤地指着会场上的情况，要主席团看看。

　　“不管你们怎么笑，我还是要再说一遍：青年就是晴雨表。

　　列宁有好几次就是这样说的。”

　　会场上霎时安静了下来。

　　“列宁是怎么说的？”有人问。

　　图夫塔马上来了精神。

　　“准备十月起义的时候，列宁曾经下令把最坚定的青年工人召集起来，发给他们武器，把他们和水兵一起派到最重要的地方去。我把这段话读给你们听听怎么样？列宁的原话我通通抄下来了，全在卡片上呢。”说着，他把手伸进了皮包。

　　“这个我们知道！”

　　“关于团结的问题，列宁是怎么说的？”

　　“关于党的纪律呢？”

　　“列宁在什么地方把青年和老一代近卫军对立起来过？”

　　图夫塔接不上碴，赶快换个话题：“刚才塔莉亚·拉古京娜在这里读了尤列涅娃的信。辩论中出现一些反常现象，我们可不能负责。至于柯察金被撵出门去这件事，我表示欣赏。一九二一年的时候，他也是反对派，他并没有制止他们的人把党委代表撵到门外去，具体来说，被撵的就是本人。在工厂里，两个小伙子挟着我的胳膊，不管我的反对，把我推到门外。舒姆斯基可以作证，他当时在场。现在让柯察金也尝尝这滋味，看是不是好受。”

　　茨韦塔耶夫气得要死，对坐在身旁的什科连科小声说：“真是，你让傻瓜向上帝祈祷，他连头都能磕破，太过分了！”

　　什科连科也小声说：“是啊！过个笨蛋准会把咱们彻底拖垮。”

　　图夫塔那又尖又细的声音还在往听众耳朵里钻：“你们在这里叱责我们，说我们瓦解党分裂党。我们有什么办法呢？既然党的多数派手里有党的机关作为武器，那我们也要有相应的对策。既然你们组织了多数派党团，我们也就有权利组织少数派党团。”

　　会场上又掀起了一阵风暴。

　　愤怒的吼声把图夫塔的耳朵都要震聋了。

　　“你说什么？再一次分裂成布尔什维克和孟什维克吗？”

　　“俄国共产党不是议会！”

　　“他们这是为所有的孟什维克卖力气——从米亚斯尼科夫到马尔托夫！”

　　图夫塔像要跳水似的扬起两只手，又起劲地讲起来，而且越说越快：“对，就是要有组织集团的自由。否则，我们这些持不同政见的人，怎么能同这么有组织、有纪律、团结一致的多数派斗争，来捍卫自己的观点呢？”

　　会场上吵嚷声越来越大了。潘克拉托夫站起来喊道：“让他把话说完，听听大有好处！图夫塔总算把有些人憋在肚子里的话端出来了。”

　　会场又安静下来。图夫塔这才发觉他说走了嘴。这些话恐怕现在还不该说。他脑子一转，赶忙收场，已经有点语无伦次了：“托洛茨基迫使中央全会承认了党内生活不正常。是他作出努力，使中央作出了关于党内民主的决定。你们当然可以开除我们，把我们打入冷宫。这不已经开始这样做了嘛。安东诺夫—奥夫谢延科的共和国革命军事委员会政治部主任的职务就给撤了嘛，可安东诺夫—奥夫谢延科是跟托洛茨基一起领导了十月革命的人。再说我吧，也从省团委给排挤出来了。论关系，究竟谁是谁非，很快就能见分晓。我们不怕你们指责我们破坏党内的和睦。列宁也受到过孟什维克同样的指责。莫斯科有百分之三十的党组织支持我们。我们还要战斗下去。”说完，他匆匆跑下了主席台。

　　杜巴瓦接过茨韦塔耶夫写给他的条子：“德米特里，你马上上去发言。当然，咱们的败局已定，无法挽回，不过图夫塔的话必须纠正，他是个信口开河的浑蛋。”

　　杜巴瓦要求发言，立刻得到允许。

　　他走上主席台的时候，全场的人都静悄悄地等待着。这种讲话前的沉寂本来是会场上常有的现象，现在却使杜巴瓦感到，大家都对他冷淡而疏远。他在各支部发言时的那股慷慨激昂的劲头已经没有了。他的情绪一天比一天低落。现在就像一堆被水浇灭的篝火，只能冒出一股呛人的浓烟；这浓烟就是他那被明显的失败和老朋友们无情的反击刺伤了的病态的自尊心，以及他那坚持错误的顽固态度。他决心硬着头皮干到底，虽然他明知这样一来，一定会离开大多数同志更远。他说话的声音不高，但是非常清楚：“我请求大家不要打断我，也不要中途插话。我想把我们的观点完整地申述一下，虽然我早就料到，这是白费唇舌，因为你们是多数。

　　“我尽量简短些。这十天来说的话已经不少。

　　“你们都知道《四十六人声明》这个文件。托洛茨基同志和党的许多著名领导干部在这个文件里尖锐批评了中央的工业政策。我们要求工业的高度集中——这是第一。我们还认为，财政改革和发行垄断性的切尔沃涅茨［切尔沃涅茨是苏俄１９２２——１９２４年币制改革时发行的纸币，有多种面额，一切尔沃涅茨相当于十卢布。流通到１９４７年。——译者］会把我们引向危机。我们本该向农民的小资产阶级自发势力施加压力，以无产阶级专政的全部威力逼迫农民交出他们的财产，但是中央没有这样做，反而否决了提高工业品价格的建议。当然，也要看到国内农民有某种罢买的情绪——他们拒绝购买工业品。

　　“反对派提议以强制推销日用消费品的方式来制止罢买的情况，并且全部日用消费品都从国外进口。中央拒绝向农民施加压力，吓唬我们说，这样会破坏同这个所谓的可靠同盟军的联盟。而我们认为，要把这股自发势力手中所有的一切都压榨出来，不留一个子儿，把钱财全都投入到社会主义工业中去。历史会证明我们是正确的。

　　“其次，我们的分歧表现在党内问题上。刚才塔莉亚·拉古京娜读了我发言的部分速记记录。我想重复说一说。

　　“为什么党的机关猛烈攻击托洛茨基呢？因为托洛茨基同党的官僚主义进行了斗争。高等学校的青年全都支持托洛茨基，他说的‘青年是党最重要的晴雨表’是一个真理。

　　“是的，同志们，托洛茨基是值得我们信赖的人。他是十月革命的领袖。他不同于季诺维也夫和加米涅夫，没有在起义面前畏缩不前。他也不同于布哈林，没有在一九一八年布列斯特和约谈判期间破坏党的统一，而布哈林，据说甚至打算因为缔结对德和约而逮捕列宁和其他同志。托洛茨基在一九○三年是第一个布尔什维克。他领导红军走向了胜利。他同列宁一样，是世界上最著名的革命家。当然，如果不是中央压制托洛茨基，我们早就向国际上的反革命势力发动进攻了。要实现真正的党内民主，所有的集团、派别都应该有权发表意见，而不能只有布尔什维克说话才算数。

　　“党的机关成了我们的不幸，领导成员清一色都是老近卫军这一事实使党有蜕化的危险。托洛茨基举出考茨基和保罗·勒维［保罗·勒维（１８８３—１９３０），德国工人运动活动家，德共早期领导成员，后因右倾机会主义被开除出党。——译者］作为活生生的例证，他是正确的。”

　　会场上的嗡嗡声和愤怒的喊声反倒使杜巴瓦更来劲了。

　　到现在为止，大家都在耐心地静听他的发言，只有一排排人头不安的晃动才显示出与会代表紧张激动的心情。

　　“叫我说，同志们，权力会毁了一个人。所以我们要奉劝你们把党的机关干部，特别是那些头头脑脑，重新下放到工厂去开机器，这一劝告也是正确的。”

　　茨韦塔耶夫在座位上幸灾乐祸地叫喊：“对！让他们去闻闻汽油味，办公室都成了他们的避风港啦。”

　　没有人答理他。大家都在等着，看杜巴瓦还会说些什么。

　　“我们再次声明，中央的政策将把国家引向毁灭。继续执行这个政策，要不了多久，财政和工业就会崩溃，农民就会给我们致命性的打击。除此而外，中央和你们这些支持中央的人在制造党的分裂……”

　　大厅里犹如爆炸了一颗手榴弹。暴风雨般的怒吼声向杜巴瓦直扑过去。愤怒的叫喊如同皮鞭抽打在杜巴瓦脸上：“可耻！”

　　“打倒分裂派！”

　　“不许血口喷人！”

　　喧闹声静止下来后，杜巴瓦结束了他的发言：“是的，说这些话，需要有足够的勇气。我无非是讲讲真实情况。你们肯定会找我们算帐，我也无所畏惧，大不了再去当钳工。我在前线打过仗，没做孬种，现在你们也吓不倒我。”

　　他当胸捶了自己一拳，决定“拂袖而去”，临了，他高喊道：“十月革命的领袖托洛茨基万岁！打倒机关老爷和官僚！”

　　杜巴瓦在一片嘲笑声中走下了讲台，这嘲笑声使他极为沮丧。如果大家气得暴跳如雷，他倒是会满意的。可是，现在却是讥笑他，就像讥笑一个唱歌走调砸了锅的演员一样。

　　“现在请什科连科发言。”执行主席说。

　　什科连科站起来说：“我不发言了。”

　　后排传来了潘克拉托夫的男低音：“我来说几句！”

　　杜巴瓦一听潘克拉托夫说话的声音，就知道了他现在的情绪。这个码头工人只有在受到什么人严重侮辱的时候，才用这种声音说话。杜巴瓦忧郁地看着这个身材高大、微微驼背的人快步走向主席台，心里感到沉重和不安。他知道潘克拉托夫要说什么。他想起昨天在索洛缅卡区和老朋友们聚会，大家都苦口婆心地劝他脱离反对派。当时同他在一起的有茨韦塔耶夫和什科连科。聚会的地点就在托卡列夫家里。在场的有潘克拉托夫、奥库涅夫、塔莉亚、沃伦采夫、泽列诺娃、斯塔罗韦罗夫、阿尔秋欣。他们说了很多希望恢复团结的话，杜巴瓦根本听不进去，始终一言不发。大

Part Two Chapter 6
---

Two men stood at the entrance to the hotel concert hall. The taller of the two wore pince-nez and a red armband marked "Commandant".

"Is the Ukrainian delegation meeting here?" Rita inquired.

"Yes," the tall man replied coldly. "Your business, Comrade?"

The tall man blocked the entrance and examined Rita from head to foot.

"Have you a delegate's mandate?"

Rita produced her card with the gilt-embossed words "Member of the Central Committee" and the man unbent at once.

"Pass in, Comrade," he said cordially. "You'll find some vacant seats over to the left."

Rita walked down the aisle, saw a vacant seat and sat down.

The meeting was evidently drawing to a close, for the chairman was summing up. His voice struck Rita as familiar.

"The council of the All-Russia Congress has now been elected. The Congress opens in two hours'time. In the meantime permit me to go over the list of delegates once more."

It was Akim! Rita listened with rapt attention as he hurriedly read out the list. As his name was called, each delegate raised his hand showing his red or white pass.

Suddenly Rita caught a familiar name: Pankratov.

She glanced round as a hand shot up but through the intervening rows she could not glimpse the stevedore's face. The names ran on, and again Rita heard one she knew — Okunev, and immediately after that another, Zharky.

Scanning the faces of the delegates she caught sight of Zharky. He was sitting not far away with Kis face half turned towards her. Yes, it was Vanya all right. She had almost forgotten that profile.

After all, she had not seen him for several years.

The roll-call continued. And then Akim read out a name that caused Rita to start violently:

"Korchagin."

Far away in one of the front rows a hand rose and fell, and, strange to say, Rita was seized with a painful longing to see the face of the man who bore the same name as her lost comrade. She could not tear her eyes away from the spot where the hand had risen, but all the heads in the rows before her seemed all alike. She got up and went down the aisle toward the front rows. At that moment Akim finished reading. Chairs were pushed back noisily and the hall was filled with the hum of voices and young laughter. Akim, trying to make himself heard above the din, shouted":

"Bolshoi Theatre ... seven o'clock. Don't be late!"

The delegates crowded to the single exit. Rita saw that she would never be able to find any of her old friends in this throng. She must try to catch Akim before he left; he would help her find the others. Just then a group of delegates passed her in the aisle on their way to the exit and she heard someone say:

"Well, Korchagin old man, we'd better be pushing off too!"

And a well-remembered voice replied: "Good, let's go."

Rita turned quickly. Before her stood a tall, dark-complexioned young man in a khaki tunic with a slender Caucasian belt, and blue riding breeches.

Rita stared at him. Then she felt his arms around her and heard his trembling voice say softly:

"Rita", and she knew that it was Pavel Korchagin. "So you're alive?"

These words told him all. She had not known that his reported death was a mistake.

The hall had emptied out long since, and the din and bustle of Tverskaya, that mighty artery of the city, poured through the open window. The clock struck six, but to both of them it seemed that they had met only a moment ago. But the clock summoned them to the Bolshoi Theatre. As they walked down the broad staircase to the exit she surveyed Pavel once more. He was a head taller than her now and more mature and self-possessed. But otherwise he was the Pavel she had always known.

"I haven't even asked you where you are working," she said.

"I am Secretary of the Regional Committee of the Komsomol, what Dubava would call a 'penpusher'," Pavel replied with a smile.

"Have you seen him?"

"Yes, and I have the most unpleasant memories of that meeting."

They stepped into the street. Automobiles hooted, noisy bustling througs filled the pavements.

They hardly exchanged a word on the way to the theatre, their minds full of the same thoughts.

They found the theatre besieged by a surging, tempestuous sea of people which tossed itself against the stone bulk of the theatre building in an effort to break through the line of Red Army men guarding the entrances. But the sentries gave admittance only to delegates, who passed through the cordon, their credentials proudly displayed. 

It was a Komsomol sea that surrounded the theatre, a sea of young people who had been unable to obtain tickets to the opening of the Congress but who were determined to get in at all costs. Some of the more agile youngsters managed to work their way into the midst of groups of delegates and by presenting some slip of red paper sometimes contrived to get as far as the entrance. 

A few even managed to slip through the doors only to be stopped by the Central Committee man on duty, or the commandant who directed the guests and delegates to their appointed places. And then, to the infinite satisfaction of all the rest of the "ticketless" fraternity, they were unceremoniously ejected. 

The theatre could not hold a fraction of all who wished to be present. 

Rita and Pavel pushed their way with difficulty to the entrance. The delegates continued to pour in, some arriving by tram, others by car. A large knot of them gathered at the entrance and the Red Army men, Komsomols themselves, were pressed back against the wall. At that moment a mighty shout arose from the crowd near the entrance: 

"Bauman District, here goes!" 

"Come on, lads, our side's winning!" 

"Hurray!" 

Through the doorway along with Pavel and Rita slipped a sharp-eyed youngster wearing a Komsomol badge, and eluding the commandant, made a beeline for the foyer. A moment later he was swallowed up by the crowd. 

"Let's sit here," Rita said, indicating two seats in a corner at the back of the stalls. 

"There is one question I must ask you," said Rita when they were seated. "It concerns bygone days, but I am sure you will not refuse to answer it. Why did you break off our studies and our friendship that time?" 

And though Pavel had been expecting this question ever since they had met, it disconcerted him. 

Their eyes met and Pavel saw that she knew. 

"I think you know the answer yourself, Rita. That happened three years ago, and now I can only condemn Pavel for what he did. As a matter of fact Korchagin has committed many a blunder, big and small, in his life. That was one of them." 

Rita smiled. 

"An excellent preamble. Now for the answer!" 

"It is not only I who was to blame," Pavel began in a low voice. "It was the Gadfly's fault too, that revolutionary romanticism of his. In those days I was very much influenced by books with vivid descriptions of staunch, courageous revolutionaries consecrated to our cause. Those men made a deep impression on me and I longed to be like them. I allowed The Gadfly to influence my feeling for you. It seems absurd to me now, and I regret it more than I can say." 

"Then you have changed your mind about The Gadfly?" 

"No, Rita, not fundamentally. I have only discarded the needless tragedy of that painful process of testing one's will. I still stand for what is most important in the Gadfly, for his courage, his supreme endurance, for the type of man who is capable of enduring suffering without exhibiting his pain to all and sundry. I stand for the type of revolutionary whose personal life is nothing as compared with the life of society as a whole." 

"It is a pity, Pavel, that you did not tell me this three years ago," said Rita with a smile that showed her thoughts to be far away. 

"A pity, you mean, because I have never been more to you than a comrade, Rita?" 

"No, Pavel, you might have been more." 

"But surely that can be remedied." 

"No, Comrade Gadfly, it is too late for that. You see, I have a little daughter now," Rita smilingly explained. "I am very fond of her father. In general, the three of us are very good friends, and so far our trio is inseparable." 

Her fingers brushed Pavel's hand. The gesture was prompted by anxiety for him, but she realised at once that it was unnecessary. Yes, he had matured in these three years, and not only physically. 

She could tell by his eyes that he was deeply hurt by her confession, but all he said was: 

"What I have left is still incomparably more than what I have just lost." And Rita knew that this was not merely an empty phrase, it was the simple truth. 

It was time to take their places nearer to the stage. They got up and went forward to the row occupied by the Ukrainian delegation. The band struck up. Scarlet streamers flung across the hall were emblazoned with the words: "The Future Is Ours!" Thousands filled the stalls, the boxes and the tiers of the great theatre. These thousands merged here in one mighty organism throbbing with inexhaustible energy. The flower of the young guard of the country's great industrial brotherhood was gathered here. Thousands of pairs of eyes reflected the glow of those words traced in burning letters over the heavy curtain: "The Future Is Ours!" And still the human tide rolled in. Another few moments and the heavy velvet curtain would move aside, and the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Young Communist League, overwhelmed for a moment by the solemnity of the occasion, would announce with a tremor in his voice: "I declare the Sixth Congress of the Russian Young Communist League open." 

Never before had Pavel Korchagin been so profoundly, so stirringly conscious of the grandeur and might of the Revolution, and an indescribable surge of pride and joy swept over him at the thought that life had brought him, a fighter and builder, to this triumphant rally of the young guard to Bolshevism. 

The Congress claimed all of his time from early morning until late at night, so that it was not until one of the final sessions that Pavel met Rita again. She was with a group of Ukrainians. 

"I am leaving tomorrow as soon as the Congress closes," she told him. "I don't know whether we will have another chance for a talk, and so I have prepared two old notebooks of my diary for you, and a short note. Read them and send them back to me by post. They will tell you all that I have not told you." 

He pressed her hand and gave her a long look as if committing her features to memory. 

They met as agreed the following day at the main entrance and Rita handed him a package and a sealed letter. There were people all around and so their leave-taking was restrained, but in her slightly misted eyes Pavel read a deep tenderness tinged with sadness. 

The next day their trains bore them away in different directions. The Ukrainian delegation occupied several carriages of the train in which Pavel travelled. He shared a compartment with some delegates from Kiev. In the evening, when the other passengers had retired and Okunev on the neighbouring berth was snoring peacefully, Pavel moved the lamp closer and opened the letter.

"Pavel, my darling! I might have told you all this when we were together, but it is better this way.

I wish only one thing: that what we spoke of before the Congress should leave no scar on your life. I know you are strong and I believe that you meant what you said. I do not take a formal attitude to life, I feel that one may make exceptions — though rarely — in one's personal relationships, provided they are founded on a genuine and deep attachment. For you I would have made that exception, but I rejected my impulse to pay tribute to our youth. I feel that there would be no true happiness in it for either of us. Still, you ought not to be so harsh to yourself, Pavel. Our life is not all struggle, there is room in it for the happiness that real love brings.

"As for the rest, the main purport of your life, I have no fears for you. I press your hand warmly."Rita."

Pavel tore up the letter reflectively; he thrust his hand out of the window and felt the wind tearingthe scraps of paper out of his hand.

By morning he had read both notebooks of Rita's diary, wrapped them up and tied them ready for posting. At Kharkov he left the train with Okunev and Pankratov and several other delegates.

Okunev was going to Kiev to fetch Talya, who was staying with Anna. Pankratov, who had been elected member of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Komsomol, also had business in Kiev.

Pavel decided to go on with them to Kiev and pay a visit to Dubava and Anna. By the time he emerged from the post-office at the Kiev station after sending off the parcel to Rita, the others had gone, so he set off alone. The tram stopped outside the house where Anna and Dubava lived. Pavel climbed the stairs to the second floor and knocked at the door on the left,Anna's room. No one answered. It was too early for her to have gone to work. "She must be sleeping," he thought. The door of the neighbouring room opened and a sleepy-eyed Dubava came out on the landing. His face was ashen and there were dark circles under his eyes. He exuded a strong smell of onions and Pavel's sharp nose caught a whiff of alcohol. Through the half-open door he caught a glimpse of the fleshy leg and shoulders of some woman on the bed.

Dubava, noticing the direction of his glance, kicked the door shut.

"You've come to see Comrade Borhart, I suppose?" he inquired hoarsely, evading Pavel's eyes.

"She doesn't live here any more. Didn't you know that?"

Korchagin, his face stern, looked searchingly at Dubava.

"No, I didn't. Where has she gone?"

Dubava suddenly lost his temper.

"That's no concern of mine!" he shouted. He belched and added with suppressed malice: "Come to console her, eh? You're just in time to fill the vacancy. Here's your chance. Don't worry, she won't refuse you. She told me many a time how much she liked you ... or however those silly women put it. Go on, strike the iron while it's hot. It will be a true communion of soul and body."

Pavel felt the blood rushing to his cheeks. Restraining himself with difficulty, he said in a low voice:

"What are you doing to yourself, Mityai! I never thought you'd fall so low. You weren't a bad fellow once. Why are you letting yourself go to the dogs?"

Dubava leaned back against the wall. The cement floor evidently felt cold to his bare feet, for he shivered.

The door opened and a woman's face with swollen eyes and puffy cheeks appeared.

"Come back in, duckie, what're you standing out there for?"

Before she could say any more, Dubava slammed the door to and stood against it.

"A fine beginning," Pavel observed. "Look at the company you're keeping. Where will it all end?"

But Dubava would hear no more.

"Are you going to tell me who I should sleep with?" he shouted. "I've had enough of yourpreaching. Now get back where you came from! Run along and tell them all that Dubava has taken to drinking and whoring."

Pavel went up to him and said in a voice of suppressed emotion:

"Mityai, get rid of that woman. I want to talk to you, for the last time...."

Dubava's face darkened. He turned on his heel and went back into the room without another word.

"The swine!" Pavel muttered and walked slowly down the stairs.

Two years went by. Time counted off the days and months, but the swift colourful pageant of life filled its seeming monotony with novelty, so that no two days were alike. The great nation of one hundred and sixty million people, the first people in the world to have taken the destiny of their vast land with its untold riches into their own hands, were engaged in the Herculean task of reviving their war-ravaged economy. The country grew stronger, new vigour flowed into its veins,and the dismal spectacle of smokeless abandoned factories was no longer to be seen.

For Pavel those two years fled by in ceaseless activity. He was not one to take life calmly, to greet each day with a leisurely yawn and retire at the stroke of ten. He lived at a swift tempo, grudging himself and others every wasted moment.

He allowed a bare minimum of time for sleep. Often the light burned in his window late into the night, and within, a group of people would be gathered around the table engrossed in study. They had made a thorough study of Volume III of Capital in these two years and the subtle mechanics of capitalist exploitation were now revealed to them.

Razvalikhin had turned up in the area where Korchagin now worked. He had been sent by the Gubernia Committee with the recommendation that he be appointed Secretary of a district Komsomol organisation. Pavel happened to be away when Razvalikhin arrived and in his absence the Bureau had sent the newcomer to one of the districts. Pavel received the news on his return without comment.

A month later Pavel made an unexpected visit to Razvalikhin's district. There was not much evidence, but what there was turned out to be sufficiently damning: the new secretary drank, he had surrounded himself with toadies and was suppressing the initiative of the conscientious members. Pavel submitted the evidence to the Bureau, and when the meeting voted administering Razvalikhin a severe reprimand, Pavel surprised everyone by getting up and saying:

"I move that he be expelled and that his expulsion be final."

The others were taken aback by the motion. It seemed too severe a measure under the circumstances. But Pavel insisted.

"The scoundrel must be expelled. He had every chance to become a decent human being, but he has remained an outsider in the Komsomol." And Pavel told the Bureau about the Berezdov incident.

"I protest!" Razvalikhin shouted. "Korchagin is simply trying to settle personal scores. What he says is nothing but idle gossip. Let him back up his charges with facts and documents. Suppose I were to come to you with a story that Korchagin had gone in for smuggling, would you expel him on the strength of that? He's got to submit written proof."

"Don't worry, I'll submit all the proofs necessary," Korchagin replied.

Razvalikhin left the room. Half an hour later Pavel persuaded the Bureau to adopt a resolution expelling Razvalikhin from the Komsomol as an alien element.

Summer came and with it the vacation season. Pavel's fellow workers left for their well-earned holiday one after another. Those whose health demanded it went to the seaside and Pavel helped them to secure sanatorium accommodations and financial assistance. They went away pale and worn, but elated at the prospect of their coming holiday. The burden of their work fell on Pavel's shoulders and he bore the added load without a murmur. In due time they returned sunburned and

full of life and energy, and others went off. Throughout the summer the office was short-handed.

But life did not lessen its swift pace, and Pavel could not afford to miss a single day's work.

The summer passed. Pavel dreaded the approach of autumn and winter for they invariably brought him much physical distress.

He had looked forward with particular eagerness to the coming of summer that year. For painful though it was for him to admit it even to himself he felt his strength waning from year to year.

There were only two alternatives: to admit that he could not endure the intensive effort his work demanded of him and declare himself an invalid, or remain at his post as long as he could. He chose the latter course.

One day at a meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Committee of the Party Dr. Bartelik, an old Party underground worker now in charge of public health in the region, came over and sat down beside him.

"You're looking rather seedy, Korchagin. How's your health? Have you been examined by the Medical Commission? You haven't? I thought as much. But you look as if you were in need of an overhauling, my friend. Come over on Thursday evening and we'll have a look at you."

Pavel did not go. He was too busy. But Bartelik did not forget him and some time later he came for Pavel and took him to the commission in which he participated as neuropathologist. The Medical Commission recommended "an immediate vacation with prolonged treatment in the Crimea, to be followed by regular medical treatment. Unless this is done serious consequences are unavoidable."

From the long list of ailments in Latin that preceded this recommendation Pavel understood only one thing — the main trouble was not in his legs, but in his central nervous system, which was seriously impaired.

Bartelik put the commission's decision before the Bureau, and the motion that Korchagin be released at once from work evoked no opposition. Korchagin himself, however, suggested that his vacation be postponed until the return of Sbitnev, Chief of the Organisational Department. He did not want to leave the Committee without leadership.

The Bureau agreed, although Bartelik objected to the delay.

And so in three weeks' time Pavel was to leave for his holiday, the first in his life. 

Accommodation had already been reserved for him in a Yevpatoria sanatorium and a paper to that effect lay in his desk drawer. 

He worked at even greater pressure in this period; he held a plenary meeting of the Regional Komsomol and drove himself relentlessly to tie up all loose ends so as to be able to leave with his mind at rest. 

And on the very eve of his departure for his first glimpse of the sea, a revolting, unbelievable thing happened. 

Pavel had gone to the Party propaganda section after work that day to attend a meeting. There was no one in the room when he arrived and so he had sat down on the windowsill by the open window behind the bookcase to wait for the others to assemble. Before long several people came in. He could not see them from behind the bookcase but he recognised one voice. It belonged to Failo, the man in charge of the Regional Economic Department, a tall, handsome fellow with a dashing military bearing, who had earned himself a reputation for drinking and running after women. 

Failo had once been a partisan and never missed an opportunity to brag laughingly of the way he had sliced off the heads of Makhno men by the dozen. Pavel could not stand the man. One day a Komsomol girl had come weeping to Pavel with the story that Failo had promised to marry her, but after living with her for a week had left her and now did not even greet her when they met. 

When the matter came up before the Control Commission, Failo wriggled out of it since the girl could give no proofs. But Pavel had believed her. He now listened while the others, unaware of his presence, talked freely. 

"Well, Failo, how goes it? What have you been up to lately?" 

The speaker was Gribov, one of Failo's boon companions. For some reason Gribov was considered a propagandist although he was ignorant, narrow-minded and stupid.

Nevertheless he prided himself on being called a propaganda worker and made a point of reminding everyone of the fact on all and every occasion. 

"You can congratulate me, my boy. I made another conquest yesterday. Korotayeva. You said nothing would come of it. That's where you were mistaken, my lad. If I go after a woman you may be sure I'll get her sooner or later," Failo boasted, adding some obscenities. 

Pavel felt the nervous chill that always seized him when he was deeply roused. Korotayeva was in charge of the Women's Department and had come to the Regional Committee at the same time as he had. Pavel knew her for a pleasant, earnest Party worker, kind and considerate to the women who came to her for help and advice, and respected by her fellow workers in the Committee. Pavel knew that she was not married, and he had no doubt that it was of her that Failo had spoken. 

"Go on, Failo, you're making it up! It doesn't sound like her." "Me, making it up? What do you take me for? I've broken in harder cases than that. You only have to know how. Got to have the right approach. Some of them will give in right away, but that kind aren't worth the trouble. Others take a whole month to come to heel.

The important thing is to understand their psychology. The right approach, that's the thing. Why, man, it's a whole science, but I'm a regular professor in such matters. Ho! Ho! Ho!" 

Failo was positively slobbering with self-satisfaction. His listeners egged him on, all agog for more juicy details.

Korchagin got up. He clenched his fists, feeling his heart pounding wildly in his chest. 

"I knew there wasn't much hope of catching Korotayeva with the usual bait, but I didn't want to give up the game, especially since I'd wagered Gribov a dozen of port wine that I'd do it. So I tried subversive tactics, so to speak. I dropped into her office once or twice, but I could see I wasn't making much of an impression.

Besides, there's all sorts of silly talk going on about me and some of it must have reached her ears.... Well, to cut a long story short, the frontal attack failed, so I tried flanking tactics. Ho! Ho! Pretty good that, eh! Well, I told her my sad story, how I'd fought at the front, wandered about the earth and had plenty of hard knocks, but I'd never been able to find the right sort of woman and so here I was a lonely cuss with nobody to love me. ... And plenty more of the same sort of tripe. I was striking at her weak spots, see? I must admit I had a lot of trouble with her. At one point I thought I'd send her to hell and drop the whole silly business. But by now it was a matter of principle, and so out of principle I had to stick it out. And finally I broke down her resistance, and what do you think? She turned out to be a virgin! Ha! Ha! What a lark!" 

And Failo went on with his revolting story. 

Pavel, seething with rage, found himself beside Failo. 

"You swine!" he roared. 

"Oh, I'm a swine, am I, and what about you eavesdropping?" 

Pavel evidently said something else, because Failo who was a bit tipsy seized him by the front of his tunic. 

"Insult me, eh?" He shouted and struck Pavel with his fist. 

Pavel snatched a heavy oak stool and knocked the other down with one blow. Fortunately for Failo, Pavel did not happen to have his revolver on him, or he would have been a dead man. 

But the senseless, incredible thing had happened, and on the day scheduled for his departure to the Crimea, Pavel stood before a Party court. 

The whole Party organisation had assembled in the town theatre. The incident had aroused much feeling, and the hearing developed into a serious discussion of Party ethics, morals and personal relationships. The case served as a signal for the discussion of the general issues involved, and the incident itself was relegated to the background. Failo behaved in the most insolent manner, smiling sardonically and declaring that he would take the case to the People's Court and that Korchagin would get a hard labour sentence for assaulting him. He refused categorically to answer any questions. 

"You want to have a nice little gossip at my expense? Nothing doing. You can accuse me of anything you like, but the fact remains that the women here have their knife in me because I don't pay any attention to them. And this whole case of yours isn't worth a damn. If this was 1918 I'd settle scores with that madman Korchagin in my own way. And now you can carry on without me." And he left the hall. 

The chairman then asked Pavel to tell what had happened. Pavel began calmly enough, though he restrained himself with difficulty. 

"The whole thing happened because I was unable to control myself. But the days when I worked more with my hands than with my head are long since gone. What happened this time was an accident. I knocked Failo down before I knew what I was doing. This is the only instance of 'partisan' action I have been guilty of in the past few years, and I condemn it, although I think that the blow was well deserved. Failo's type is a disgusting phenomenon. I cannot understand, I shall never believe that a revolutionary, a Communist, can be at the same time a dirty beast and a scoundrel. The only positive aspect of the whole business is that it has focussed our attention on the behaviour of our fellow Communists in private life." 

The overwhelming majority of the membership voted in favour of expelling Failo from the Party. 

Gribov was administered a severe reprimand for giving false evidence and a warning that the next offence would mean expulsion. The others who had taken part in the conversation admitted their mistake and got off with a word of censure. 

Bartelik then told the gathering about the state of Pavel's nerves and the meeting protested violently when the comrade who had been appointed by the Party to investigate the case moved that Korchagin be reprimanded. The investigator withdrew his motion and Pavel was acquitted.

A few days later Pavel was on his way to Kharkov. The Regional Committee of the Party had finally granted his insistent request to be released from his job and placed at the disposal of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Komsomol. He had been given a good testimonial. Akim was one of the secretaries of the Central Committee.

Pavel went to see him as soon as he arrived in Kharkov and told him the whole story. 

Akim looked over Pavel's testimonial. It declared him to be "boundlessly devoted to the Party", but added: "A levelheaded Party worker, on the whole, he is, however, on rare occasions apt to lose his self-control. This is due to the serious condition of his nervous system." 

"Spoiled a good testimonial with that fact, Pavel," said Akim. "But never mind, boy, such things happen to the strongest of us. Go south and build up your health and when you come back we'll talk about work." 

And Akim gave him a hearty handshake.

The Kommunar Sanatorium of the Central Committee. White buildings overgrown with vines set amid gardens of rose bushes and sparkling fountains, and vacationers in white summer clothes and bathing suits.... A young woman doctor entered his name in the register and he found himself in a spacious room in the corner building. Dazzling white bed linen, virginal cleanliness and peace, blessed undisturbed peace. 

After a refreshing bath and a change of clothes, Pavel hurried down to the beach. 

The sea lay before him calm, majestic, a blue-black expanse of polished marble, spreading all the way to the horizon. Far away in the distance where sea met sky a bluish haze hovered and a molten sun was reflected in a ruddy glow on its surface. The massive contours of a mountain range were dimly seen through the morning mist.

Pavel breathed the invigorating freshness of the sea breeze deep into his lungs and feasted his eyes on the infinite calm of the blue expanse. 

A wave rolled lazily up to his feet, licking the golden sand of the beach.

　　旅馆的音乐厅门口站着两个人。其中一个大个子，戴副夹鼻眼镜，胳臂上佩着写有“纠察队长”字样的红袖章。

　　“乌克兰代表团是在这儿开会吗？”丽达问。

　　大个子打着官腔回答说：“是的！有什么事吗？”

　　“请让我进去。”

　　大个子堵住半边门，打量了一下丽达，问：“您的证件呢？只有正式代表和列席代表才能进去。”

　　丽达从提包里拿出烫金的代表证。大个子看见上面印着“中央委员会委员”的字样，怠慢的态度马上不见了，他变得彬彬有礼，像对“自家人”一样亲热地说：“请吧，请进，左边有空位子。”

　　丽达从一排排椅子中间穿过去，看见一个空座位，坐了下来。代表会议就要结束了。丽达注意地听着主席的讲话。这个人的声音她听起来很耳熟。

　　“同志们，出席全俄代表大会各代表团首席代表会议的代表，以及出席代表团会议的代表，已经选举完毕。现在离开会还有两个小时。请允许我再次核对一下已经报到的代表名单。”

　　丽达认出这个人是阿基姆，他正匆忙地念着代表名单。

　　每叫一个名字，就有一只手拿着红色或者白色代表证举起来。

　　丽达聚精会神地听着。

　　一个熟悉的名字传进了她的耳朵：“潘克拉托夫。”

　　丽达回头朝举手的地方看去，那里坐着一排排代表，却看不到码头工人那熟悉的面孔。名单念得很快，她又听到一个熟悉的名字——奥库涅夫，接着又是一个——扎尔基。

　　丽达看见了扎尔基。他就坐在附近，在她的斜对面。那不就是他的侧影吗，已经不大能认出来了……是他，是伊万。

　　丽达已经好几年没有见到他了。

　　名单迅速地往下念。突然，她听到一个名字，不由得哆嗦了一下：“柯察金。”

　　前面很远的地方举起一只手。随后又放下了。说来奇怪，丽达竟迫不及待地想看看那个和她的亡友同姓的人。她目不转睛地盯着刚才举手的地方，但是所有的头看上去全都一样。

　　丽达站起来，顺着靠墙的通道向前排走去。这时候，阿基姆已经念完了名单，马上响起一阵挪动椅子的声音，代表们大声说起话来，青年人发出爽朗的笑声，于是阿基姆竭力盖过大厅里的嘈杂声，喊道：“大家不要迟到！……大剧院，七点！……”

　　大厅门口很拥挤。

　　丽达明白，她不可能在拥挤的人流中找到刚才名单中念到的熟人。唯一的办法是盯住阿基姆，再通过他找到其他人。

　　她让最后一批代表从身边走过，自己朝阿基姆走去。

　　突然，她听到身后有人说：“怎么样，柯察金，咱们也走吧，老弟。”

　　接着，一个那么熟悉、那么难忘的声音回答说：“走吧。”

　　丽达急忙回过头来，只见面前站着一个高大而微黑的青年，穿着草绿色军便服和蓝色马裤，腰上系一条高加索窄皮带。

　　丽达睁圆了眼睛看着他，直到一双手热情地抱住她，颤抖的声音轻轻地叫了一声“丽达”，她才明白，这真是保尔·柯察金。

　　“你还活着？”

　　这句问话说明了一切。原来她一直不知道他死去的消息是误传。

　　大厅里的人全走光了。从敞开的窗户里传来了本市的交通要道——特维尔大街的喧闹声。时钟响亮地敲了六下，可是他俩都觉得见面才几分钟。钟声催促他们到大剧院去。当他们沿着宽阔的阶梯向大门走去的时候，她又仔细看了看保尔。他现在比她高出半个头，还是从前的模样，只是更加英武，更加沉着了。

　　“你看，我还没问你在哪儿工作呢。”

　　“我现在是共青团专区委员会书记，或者像杜巴瓦所说的，当‘机关老爷’了。”说着，保尔微微笑了一下。

　　“你见过他吗？”

　　“见过，不过那次见面留下的印象很不愉快。”

　　他们走上了大街。街上，汽车鸣着喇叭疾驰而过，喧嚷的行人来来往往。他俩一直走到大剧院，路上几乎没有说话，心中想着同一件事情。剧院周围人山人海，狂热而固执的人群一次又一次向剧院石砌的大厦涌过去，一心想冲进红军战士把守的入口。但是，铁面无私的卫兵只放代表进去。代表们骄傲地举着证件，从警戒线穿过去。

　　剧院周围的人海里全是共青团员。他们没有列席证，但是都千方百计想参加代表大会的开幕式。有些小伙子挺机灵，混在代表群里朝前挤，手里也拿着红纸片，冒充证件。他们有时竟混到了会场门口，个别人甚至钻进了大门，但是他们马上被引导来宾和代表进入会场的值班中央委员或纠察队长抓住，给赶出门来，这使得那些混不进去的“无证代表”大为高兴。

　　想参加开幕式的人很多，剧院连二十分之一也容纳不下。

　　丽达和保尔费了很大的劲，才挤到会场门口。代表们乘坐电车、汽车陆续来到会场。门口挤得水泄不通。红军战士——他们也是共青团员——渐渐招架不住了，他们被挤得紧紧贴在墙上，门前喊声响成一片：“挤呀！鲍曼学院的小伙子们，挤呀！”

　　“挤呀，老弟，咱们要胜利了！”

　　“把恰普林和萨沙·科萨列夫［恰普林（１９０２—１９３８）和科萨列夫（１９０３—１９３９）当时先后担任共青团中央总书记的职务。——译者］叫来，他们会放我们进去的！”

　　“加——油——啊！”

　　一个戴青年共产国际徽章的小伙子，灵活得像条泥鳅，随着保尔和丽达挤进了大门。他躲过纠察队长，飞速跑进休息室，一转眼就钻进代表群中不见了。

　　“咱们就坐在这儿吧。”他们走进正厅后，丽达指着后排的位子说。

　　他们在角落里坐了下来。丽达看了看手表。

　　“离开会还有四十分钟，你给我讲讲杜巴瓦和安娜的情况吧。”丽达说。保尔目不转睛地注视着她，她有点不好意思。

　　“我不久前去参加全乌克兰代表会议，顺便去看望了他们。跟安娜见了几次面，跟杜巴瓦只见了一次，这一次还不如不见的好。”

　　“为什么？”

　　保尔不做声。他右眼的眉梢微微颤动了一下。丽达知道为什么会有这动作，这是他激动的信号。

　　“你说说吧，我什么都不知道。”

　　“丽达，我本不想现在说这件事，可你非要我说，我只好服从了。他们的关系是当着我的面彻底破裂的，依我看，安娜是别无选择。他们积累了那么多矛盾，一刀两断是唯一的出路。感情破裂的根源是他们在党内问题上的分歧。杜巴瓦始终是个反对派。我在哈尔科夫听人说起他在基辅的发言，他是和舒姆斯基一起去基辅的。”

　　“什么，难道舒姆斯基是托洛茨基分子？”

　　“是的，他曾经是，现在离开了他们。我跟扎尔基找他谈了很久。现在他已经站到咱们这边来了。而对杜巴瓦，这话却无论如何不能说。杜巴瓦是越陷越深。咱们还是回过头来先讲安娜吧。她把什么都告诉我了。杜巴瓦搞反党活动是一头扎进去就出不来。安娜没少受他的气，比方说，他奚落她：‘你是党的一匹小灰马，主人指东你走东，主人指西你走西。’还有比这更难听的。几次冲突过后，他们就成了陌路人。安娜提出分手，杜巴瓦显然不愿意失去她，他保证，今后他们之间不会再有磨擦，请她不要离开他，要帮助他渡过难关。安娜同意了。有一段时间她似乎觉得，一切都会好起来。她没有再听到他恶语伤人，她给他讲道理，他也不做声，不再反驳。安娜相信，他在认真检讨过去的立场。

　　“她从扎尔基那里听说，杜巴瓦在共产主义大学也不再捣乱，跟扎尔基的个人关系也能做到和睦相处。不久前安娜在单位感到不大舒服（她已怀孕），回家休息，关上门后，便躺下了。她和杜巴瓦住的是套间，两个房间有门相通，不过两人讲好把门钉死了。

　　“不一会儿杜巴瓦带了一大帮同志到家里来，结果安娜无意中成了一个有组织的托派小组会议的见证人。她听到的那一大堆东西，连做梦都梦不到。而且，为了迎接全乌克兰共青团代表会议，他们还印刷了一份宣言之类的东西，准备藏在衣襟下，偷偷散发给代表们。安娜这才猛然清醒：杜巴瓦原来是在耍手腕。

　　“等大家走后，安娜把杜巴瓦叫到自己房间，要求他解释刚才发生的一切。

　　“我正好那一天到达哈尔科夫，参加代表会议，在中央委员会遇见了基辅的代表。

　　“塔莉亚给了我安娜的地址，她住得很近，我决定午饭前去看望她，因为在她工作的党中央妇女部我们没能找到她，她在那里担任指导员的职务。

　　“塔莉亚和其他几位同志也答应去看她。你瞧，不早不晚，我到的时候，正好赶上这坎儿了。”

　　保尔苦笑了一下。

　　丽达听着，微微皱起眉头，两只胳膊拄在座位的天鹅绒把手上。保尔不再出声。他望着丽达，回想她以前在基辅时的模样，又同眼前的她比较，再次意识到她已长成了一个体态健美的、迷人的青年女性。她身上那件终年不变的军便服不见了，取而代之的是简朴但缝制得很精致的蓝色连衣裙。她的手指抓住他的手，轻轻拽了一下，要他继续说下去。

　　“我听着呢，保尔。”

　　保尔接着往下说，也抓住了她的手指，不再松开。

　　“安娜见到我，掩饰不住心里的喜悦。杜巴瓦则是冷冰冰的。原来他已经知道我同反对派作斗争的情况。

　　“这次见面有点不伦不类。我似乎要充当一个法官之类的角色。安娜不住嘴地讲，杜巴瓦在房间里走来走去，一支接着一支抽烟，显然，他又烦躁，又生气。

　　“‘你瞧，保夫鲁沙，他不单欺骗我，还欺骗党。他组织什么地下小组，还在那儿煽风点火，当着我的面却说洗手不干了。他在共产主义大学公开承认代表会议的决议是正确的。他自称是个“正派人”，可同时又在瞒天过海，耍阴谋。今天的事，我要写信报告省监察委员会。’安娜气愤地说。

　　“杜巴瓦很不满意，嘟嘟哝哝说：“‘有什么了不起？走吧，去汇报吧。这种党，连老婆都当特务，偷听丈夫的谈话，你以为我很乐意当这个党的党员！’“这种话对安娜来说当然太过分了。她喊了起来，叫杜巴瓦走开。他出去以后，我对安娜说，让我找他谈一谈。安娜说这是白费劲。不过我还是去了。我想我和他曾经是好朋友，他还不是不可救药。

　　“我到了他房间。他躺在床上，马上堵我的嘴，说：“‘你别来说服教育，我对这一套腻烦透了。’“可我还是得说。

　　“我想起了过去的事，说：“‘从我们以前犯的错误中。你什么教训也没有吸取？杜巴瓦，你记不记得，小资产阶级意识是怎么把我们推上反对党的道路的？’“你猜他怎么回答我？他说：“‘那个时候，保尔，我和你都是工人，没什么顾虑，心里想什么，嘴上说什么，而我们想的东西并没有什么错。实行新经济政策前是真正的革命。现在呢，是一种半资产阶级革命。发新经济政策财的人个个脑满肠肥，绫罗绸缎身上挂，可国内的失业人员多得不可胜数。我们政府和党的上层人士也在靠新经济政策发迹。还跟那些女资本家勾搭上了，整个政策的目标都是发展资本主义。讲到无产阶级专政那就羞羞答答，对农民则采取自由主义态度，培植富农，用不多久，富农就会在农村当家作主。你等着瞧吧，再过五六年，苏维埃政权就会在不知不觉中被人埋葬掉，跟法国热月政变之后的情形一样。新经济政策的暴发户们将成为新的资产阶级共和国的部长，而你我这样的人，要是还敢啰嗦，连脑袋也会给他们揪下来。一句话，这么走下去，死路一条。’“看到了吧，丽达，杜巴瓦拿不出任何新鲜货色，还是托洛茨基派的陈词滥调。我跟他谈了很久。

　　“最后我明白了，跟他争辩无异对牛弹琴。依我看，杜巴瓦是拽不回来了。为了跟他谈话，我开会都迟到了。

　　“临别的时候，他大概是要‘抬举’我一下，说：“‘保尔，我知道你还没有僵化，没有成为因为怕丢官才投赞成票的官僚。不过，你是那种眼睛里除了红旗之外什么也看不见的人。’“晚上，基辅的代表都到安娜家来聚会。其中有扎尔基和舒姆斯基。安娜已经去过省监察委员会，我们都认为她做得对。我在哈尔科夫待了八天，同安娜在中央委员会见过几次面。她搬了家。我听塔莉亚说，安娜打算流产。跟杜巴瓦分手的事，看来已无可挽回。塔莉亚在哈尔科夫又留了几天，帮她办这件事。

　　“我们动身去莫斯科那天，扎尔基听人说，党的三人小组给了杜巴瓦严厉申斥加警告的处分。共产主义大学的党委也同意这个决定。离最高处分只差一步，这样，杜巴瓦总算没被清除出党。”

　　会场里渐渐拥挤起来，人群还在不断往里涌，周围是一片谈话声、笑声。巨大的剧场正在接待这世所罕见的、充满活力的人流，这些年轻的布尔什维克是如此热情奔放，如此乐观，如此勇往直前，犹如从山上奔腾而下的急流。

　　嘈杂声越来越大了。保尔似乎觉得，丽达并不在听他说话。他刚一住嘴，丽达随即说：“杜巴瓦的事，我想咱们今天就说这些吧。干吗把余下的时间都花费在这上面呢！这儿这么明亮，生活气息这么浓……”

　　丽达朝他身边挪了挪身子，他们挨得更近了，说起话来都不大方便。为了声音小些，她朝他探过身去。

　　“有一个问题，我想要你回答我。”丽达说。“虽然事情已经过去，但是我想你会告诉我的：当初你为什么要中断咱们的学习和咱们的友谊呢？”

　　虽然保尔刚一跟她见面，就预料到她会提这个问题，现在他还是感到很尴尬。他们的目光相遇了，保尔看出：她是知道原因的。

　　“丽达，我想你是完全清楚的。这是三年前的事了，现在我只能责备当时的保尔。总的说来，保尔一生中犯过不少大大小小的错误，你现在问的就是其中的一个。”

　　丽达微微一笑。

　　“这是一个很好的开场白。但是我想听到的是答案。”

　　保尔低声说下去：“这件事不能完全怪我，‘牛虻’和他的革命浪漫主义也有责任。有一些书塑造了革命者的鲜明形象，他们英勇无畏，刚毅坚强，彻底献身于革命事业，给我留下了不可磨灭的印象，我产生了做这样的人的愿望。对你的感情，我就是照‘牛虻’的方式处理的。这样做，我现在感到很可笑，不过更多的是遗憾。”

　　“这么说。现在你对‘牛虻’的评价改变了？”

　　“不，丽达，基本上没有改变！我否定的只是毫无必要地以苦行考验意志的悲剧成分。至于‘牛虻’的主要方面，那我是肯定的，我赞成他的勇敢，他的非凡的毅力，赞成他这种类型的人，能够忍受巨大的痛苦而不在任何人面前流露。我赞成这种革命者的典型，对他来说，个人的一切同集体事业相比较，是微不足道的。”

　　“保尔，这番话三年以前就应该说，可是直到现在才说，只有使人感到遗憾了。”丽达面带笑容，若有所思地说。

　　“丽达，你说使人遗憾，是不是因为我永远只能是你的同志，而不能成为更近的人呢？”

　　“不是，保尔，你本来是可以成为更近的人的。”

　　“那么还来得及补救。”

　　“有点晚了，牛虻同志。”

　　丽达微笑着说了这句笑话，接着她解释说：“我现在已经有了个小女孩。她有个父亲，是我的好朋友。我们三个生活得很和美，现在是三位一体，密不可分。”

　　她用手指轻轻触了一下保尔的手，表示对他的关切。但是她马上就明白了，这个动作是多余的。是的，这三年来，他不只是在体格方面成长了。丽达知道他现在很难过——这从他的眼睛里可以看得出来，但是他毫不做作地、诚挚地说：“不管怎么样，我得到的东西还是要多得多，刚才失去的东西是没法同它相比的。”

　　保尔和丽达站了起来。应该坐到离台近一些的地方去了。

　　他们朝乌克兰代表团座席走去。乐队奏起了乐曲。巨大的横幅标语鲜红似火，闪光的大字似乎在呼喊：“未来是属于我们的”。楼上楼下的几千个座位和包厢已经坐满了人。这几千个人聚集在一起，形成一个强大的变压器——这是一个取之不尽、用之不竭的原动力。宏伟的剧院接待了伟大的工人阶级的青年近卫军的精华。几千双眼睛凝视着沉重的帷幕的上方，每双眼睛都是亮晶晶的，反映出“未来是属于我们的”几个闪光的大字。

　　人们仍在不断涌进会场。再过几分钟，沉重的天鹅绒帷幕就要慢慢拉开，全俄共青团中央委员会书记恰普林在这无比庄严的时刻，也会暂时失去平静，他将激动地宣布：“全俄共产主义青年团第六次代表大会现在开幕。”

　　保尔从来没有这样鲜明、这样深刻地感受到革命的伟大和威力，他感到有一种难以言喻的骄傲和前所未有的喜悦。这是生活给他的，是生活把他这个战士和建设者送到这里来，参加这个布尔什维主义青年近卫军的胜利大会的。

　　大会每天从清晨开到深夜，占去了与会者的全部时间。保尔只是在最后一次会议上才又见到了丽达。她正和一群乌克兰代表在一起［作者手稿中此处还有一段文字，描写共青团员在丽达的哥哥家开晚会的情景。丽达在晚会上说：“朋友们，我深深相信，不出几年，共青团会从自己的队伍里推出几位大作家，他们将通过艺术的形象讲述我们英勇的过去，讲述我们同样光荣的现在，谁知道，说不定在座的诸位中就会有人用锋利的笔触，把我们这些人也挖苦一番呢……”——编者］。丽达对他说：“明天大会闭幕以后，我马上就要回去。不知道临别的时候，还能不能再谈一次。所以我今天把过去的两本日记找了出来，还写了一封短信，准备留给你。你看完了，把日记给我寄回来。这些东西会把我没向你说的事情全告诉你。”

　　保尔握了握她的手，目不转睛地看了她一会儿，好像要把她的面容铭记在心里。

　　第二天，他们如约在大门口见面。丽达交给他一个包和一封封好的信。周围人很多，因此他们告别的时候很拘谨，保尔只是在她那湿润的眼睛里看到了深切的温情和淡淡的忧伤。

　　一天以后，列车载着他们朝不同的方向走了。

　　乌克兰代表分坐在几节车厢里。保尔和基辅小组在一起。

　　晚上，大家全睡了，奥库涅夫也在旁边的铺位上发出了轻轻的鼾声。保尔移近灯光，打开那封信：

　　保夫鲁沙，亲爱的！

　　这些话我本来可以当面告诉你，不过还是写下来更好一些。我只有一个希望，就是我和你在大会开幕那天谈的事，不要在你生活里留下痛苦的回忆。我知道你很坚强，所以我相信你说的话。我对生活的看法并不太拘泥于形式。在私人关系上，有的时候，当然非常少见，如果确实出于不平常的、深沉的感情，是可以有例外的。你就可以得到这种例外，不过，我还是打消了偿还我们青春宿债的念头。我觉得，那样做不会给我们带来很大的愉快。保尔，你对自己不要那样苛刻。我们的生活里不仅有斗争，而且有美好感情带来的欢乐。

　　至于你生活的其他方面，就是说，对你生活的主要内容，我是完全放心的。紧握你的双手。

　　丽达。

　　保尔沉思着，把信撕成碎片，然后两手伸出窗外，任凭风把纸片吹走。

　　第二天早晨，保尔读完两本日记，把它们包起捆好。到了哈尔科夫，奥库涅夫、潘克拉托夫、保尔和另外一些乌克兰代表都下了车。奥库涅夫要把住在安娜那里的塔莉亚接走。

　　潘克拉托夫当选为乌克兰共青团中央委员，有事要办。保尔决定顺便看看扎尔基和安娜，然后同奥库涅夫他们一起到基辅去。他到车站邮局给丽达寄日记本，耽搁了一会儿，出来的时候朋友们已经全走了。

　　他坐电车到了安娜和杜巴瓦的住所。保尔走上二楼，敲了敲左面的门——安娜就住在这里。里面没有人应声。时间还很早，安娜不会这么早就去上班。保尔想：“她也许还没醒。”

　　这时隔壁的门打开了，睡眼矇眬的杜巴瓦走了出来，站在门口。他脸色灰暗，眼圈发青，身上散发着刺鼻的洋葱味，保尔那敏锐的嗅觉还闻到了他嘴里喷出来的隔夜的酒气。从半开的房门里，保尔看见床上躺着一个胖女人，确切些说，是看到这女人的肩膀和一条光着的肥腿。

　　杜巴瓦注意到了他的目光，用脚一踹，把门关上了。

　　“你怎么，是来找安娜·博哈特同志的吗？”他眼睛看着墙角，用沙哑的声音问。“她已经不在这儿了。你难道不知道吗？”

　　保尔沉着脸，仔细地打量着他。

　　“我不知道。她搬到哪儿去了？”

　　杜巴瓦突然大发脾气。

　　“这个我管不着。”他打了一个嗝，又压住火气，不怀好意地说：“你是来安慰她的吧？好啊，来得正是时候。位子已经腾出来了，行动起来吧。你肯定不会碰钉子。她跟我提过好几次，说她挺喜欢你，或者像娘们的另一种说法……抓住机会吧，那你们精神和肉体就都一致起来了。”

　　保尔感到两颊发烧。他竭力克制自己，轻声说：“德米特里，你怎么堕落到这种地步！没想到你会变得这么无赖。过去你是个不错的小伙子嘛。你为什么要堕落下去呢？”

　　杜巴瓦把身子靠在墙上。看样子他光脚站在水泥地上有点冷，所以把身子蜷缩起来。房门打开了。一个睡眼惺忪、两腮浮肿的女人探出头来，说：“我的小猫，进来吧，在那儿站着干什么？……”

　　杜巴瓦没让她说完，猛地把门关上，用身子顶住。

　　“真是个好的开端……”保尔说。“你把什么人领到房里来了！这样下去怎么得了啊？”

　　杜巴瓦显然不愿意再谈下去，他大声喊道：“连我该跟什么人睡觉也要你们下指示吗！这些说教我早就听够了！你从哪儿来的，滚回哪儿去吧！去告诉大家，就说我杜巴瓦现在又喝酒，又嫖女人！”

　　保尔走到他跟前，激动地说：“德米特里，把这个女人撵走，我想最后再跟你谈一次……”

　　杜巴瓦把脸一沉，转身走进了房间。

　　“呸，这个坏蛋！”保尔低声骂了一句，慢慢走下楼去。

　　两年过去了。无情的时光一天天、一月月流逝着，而生活，飞速前进而又丰富多彩的生活，总是给这些表面似乎单调的日子带来新的内容，每天都和前一天不一样。一亿六千万伟大的人民，开天辟地第一次成为自己辽阔土地和无穷宝藏的主人，他们英勇地、紧张地劳动着，重建被战争破坏了的经济。国家在日益巩固，在积聚力量。不久前不少工厂还废置着，没有一点生气，一片荒凉，可是现在烟囱全都冒烟了。

　　保尔觉得，这两年过得飞快，简直是不知不觉地过去的。

　　他不会从容不迫地过日子，早晨不会懒洋洋地打着哈欠迎接黎明，晚上也不会十点钟准时就寝。他总是急急忙忙地生活，不仅自己急急忙忙，而且还催促别人。

　　他舍不得在睡眠上多花时间。深夜还经常可以看到他的窗户亮着灯光，屋子里有几个人在埋头读书。这是他们在学习。两年里他学完了《资本论》第三卷，弄清了资本主义剥削的精巧结构。

　　有一天，拉兹瓦利欣突然来到保尔工作的那个专区。省委派他来，建议让他担任一个区的共青团区委书记。保尔当时出差在外。在保尔缺席的情况下，常委会把拉兹瓦利欣派到一个区里。保尔回来后，知道了这件事，但是什么也没有说。

　　一个月过去了。保尔到拉兹瓦利欣那个区视察工作。他发现的问题虽然不多，但是其中已经有这样一些情况：拉兹瓦利欣酗酒，拉拢一帮阿谀奉承的人，排挤好同志。保尔把这些事情提到常委会上讨论。当大家一致主张给拉兹瓦利欣严厉申斥处分的时候，保尔出人意料地说：“应该永远开除，不许重新入团。”

　　大家都很吃惊，感到这样处分过重，但是保尔坚持说：“一定要开除这个坏蛋。对这个堕落的少爷学生，我们已经给过他重新做人的机会，他纯粹是混进团里的异己分子。”

　　保尔把在别列兹多夫发生的事讲了一遍。

　　“我对柯察金的指摘提出强烈抗议。他这是报私仇，谁都可以捏造罪名陷害我。让柯察金拿出真凭实据来。我也会给他编几条，说他搞过走私活动——凭这个就把他开除吗？不行，得让他拿出证据来！”拉兹瓦利欣大喊大叫。

　　“你等着吧，会给你证据的。”保尔对他说。

　　拉兹瓦利欣出去了。半小时后保尔说服了大家，常委会通过决议：“将异己分子拉兹瓦利欣开除出团。”

　　入夏以后，朋友们一个个都去休假了。身体不好的都到海滨去。一到这个时候，休养成了大家热切盼望的事，保尔忙着给同志们张罗疗养证，申请补助，打发他们去休息。同志们走的时候，脸色苍白，神情倦怠，但是都很高兴。他们留下的工作全压在保尔肩上，他就全力以赴地工作，像一匹驯顺的马拉着重载爬坡一样。这些同志晒得黑黑的回来了，个个精神饱满，精力充沛。于是，另一批同志又疗养去了。整个夏天总有人外出，可是生活是不会在原地踏步的，生活要前进，保尔也就没有一天能够离开他的岗位。

　　年年夏天都是这样过的。

　　保尔不喜欢秋天和冬天，因为这两个季节给他肉体上造成很多痛苦。

　　今年，他特别焦急地盼望夏天快到。精力一年不如一年了，即使只向自己承认这一点，也使他感到非常难过。现在只有两条出路：要么承认自己经受不了紧张工作带来的种种困难，承认自己是个残废；要么坚守岗位，直到完全不能工作为止。他选择了后一条。

　　有一回，专区党委常委会开会的时候，专区卫生处长巴尔捷利克，一个做过地下工作的老医生，凑到保尔跟前，说：“保尔，你的气色很不好。到医务委员会检查过吗？身体怎么样？大概没去过吧？我记不清了。反正你得检查一下，亲爱的朋友。星期四来吧，下午来。”

　　保尔有事脱不开身，没有到医务委员会去。可是巴尔捷利克并没有忘记他，亲自把他拉到自己那里。医生给保尔仔细检查了身体，巴尔捷利克也以神经病理学家的身份参加了。

　　检查之后，写了如下处理意见：医务委员会认为柯察金同志必须立即停止工作，去克里木长期疗养，并进一步认真治疗，否则难免发生严重后果。

　　处理意见的前面，用拉丁文写了一长串病名。从这些病名中，保尔了解到的只是：他的主要灾难不在腿上，而是中枢神经系统受到严重损伤。

　　巴尔捷利克把医务委员会的决定送交常委会批准，没有一个人反对立即解除保尔的工作，但是保尔自己提议，等共青团专区委员会组织部长斯比特涅夫休假回来之后他再离开。保尔怕丢下专区团委的工作没有人负责。这个要求虽然遭到巴尔捷利克的反对，大家还是同意了。

　　再有三个星期，他就可以去度他一生中的第一次休假了。

　　保尔这些日子工作抓得更紧了。他召开了专区团委全体会议，为了能够放心离开，他竭力在走之前把工作安排妥当。

　　就在他要去休养，要去看他一生中从未见过的大海的前夕，他遇到了一件十分荒唐而可憎的事，这是完全出乎他的意料的。

Part Two Chapter 7
---

The garden of the central poly clinic adjoined the grounds of the Central Committee Sanatorium. 

The patients used it as a short cut on their way home from the beach. Pavel loved to rest here in the shade of a spreading plane tree which grew beside a high limestone wall. From this quiet nook he could watch the lively movement of the crowd strolling along the garden paths and listen to the music of the band in the evenings without being jostled by the gay throngs of the large health resort. 

Today too he had sought his favourite retreat. Drowsy from the sunshine and the bath he had just taken, he stretched himself out luxuriously on the chaise-lounge and fell into a doze. His bath towel and the book he was reading, Furmanov's Insurrection, lay on the chair beside him. His first days in the sanatorium had brought no relief to his nerves and his headaches continued. His ailment had so far baffled the sanatorium doctors, who were still trying to get to the root of the trouble. Pavel was sick of the perpetual examinations. They wearied him and he did his best to avoid his ward doctor, a pleasant woman with the curious name of Yerusalimchik, who had a difficult time hunting for her unwilling patient and persuading him to let her take him to some specialist or other. 

"I'm tired of the whole business," Pavel would plead with her. "Five times a day I have to tell the same story and answer all sorts of silly questions: was your grandmother insane, or did your great-grandfather suffer with rheumatism? How the devil should I know what he suffered from? I never saw him in my life! Every doctor tries to induce me to confess that I had gonorrhea or something worse, until I swear I'm ready to punch their bald heads. Give me a chance to rest, that's all I want. 

If I'm going to let myself be diagnosed all the six weeks of my stay here I'll become a danger to society." 

Yerusalimchik would laugh and joke with him, but a few minutes later she would take him gently by the arm and lead him to the surgeon, chattering volubly all the way. 

But today there was no examination in the offing, and dinner was an hour away. Presently, through his doze, he heard steps approaching. He did not open his eyes.

"They'll think I'm asleep and go away," he thought. Vain hope! He heard the chair beside him creak as someone sat down. 

A faint whiff of perfume told him it was a woman. He opened his eyes. The first thing he saw was a dazzling white dress and a pair of bronzed feet encased in soft leather slippers, then a boyish bob, two enormous eyes, and a row of white teeth as sharp as a mouse's. She gave him a shy smile. 

"I haven't disturbed you, I hope?" 

Pavel made no reply, which was not very polite of him, but he still hoped that she would go. 

"Is this your book?" She was turning the pages of Insurrection. 

"It is." 

There was a moment of silence. 

"You're from the Kommunar Sanatorium, aren't you?" 

Pavel stirred impatiently. Why couldn't she leave him in peace? Now she would start asking about his illness. He would have to go. 

"No," he replied curtly. 

"I was sure I had seen you there." 

Pavel was on the point of rising when a deep, pleasant woman's voice behind him said: 

"Why, Dora, what are you doing here?'' 

A plump, sunburned, fair-haired girl in a beach costume seated herself on the edge of a chair. She glanced quickly at Korchagin.

"I've seen you somewhere, Comrade. You're from Kharkov, aren't you?"

"Yes."

"Where do you work?"

Pavel decided to put an end to the conversation.

"In the garbage disposal department," he replied. The laugh this sally evoked made him jump.

"You're not very polite, are you, Comrade?"

That is how their friendship began. Dora Rodkina turned out to be a member of the Bureau of the Kharkov City Committee of the Party and later, when they came to know each other well, she often teased him about the amusing incident with which their acquaintance had started.

One afternoon at an open-air concert in the grounds of the Thalassa Sanatorium Pavel ran across his old friend Zharky. And curious to relate, it was a foxtrot that brought them together.

After the audience had been treated to a highly emotional rendering of Oh, Nights of Burning Passion by a buxom soprano, a couple sprang onto the stage. The man, half-naked but for a red top hat, some shiny spangles on his hips, a dazzling white shirt front and bow tie, in feeble imitation of a savage, and his doll-faced partner in voluminous skirts. To the accompaniment of a delighted buzz from the crowd of beefy-necked shopowners standing behind the armchairs and cots occupied by the sanatorium patients, the couple gyrated about the stage in the intricate figures of a foxtrot. A more revolting spectacle could scarcely be imagined. The fleshy man in his idiotic top hat, with his partner pressed tightly to him, writhed on the stage in suggestive poses. Pavel heard the stertorous breathing of some fat carcass at his back. He turned to go when someone in the front row got up and shouted:

"Enough of this brothel show! To hell with it!"

It was Zharky.

The pianist stopped playing and the violin subsided with a squeak. The couple on the stage ceased writhing. The crowd at the back set up a vicious hissing.

"What impudence to interrupt a number!"

"All Europe is dancing foxtrot!"

"Outrageous!"

But Seryozha Zhbanov, Secretary of the Cherepovets Komsomol organisation and one of the Kommunar patients, put four fingers into his mouth and emitted a piercing whistle. Others followed his example and in an instant the couple vanished from the stage, as if swept off by a gust of wind. The obsequious compere who looked like nothing so much as an old-time flunkey, announced that the concert troupe was leaving.

"Good riddance to bad rubbish!" a lad in a sanatorium bathrobe shouted amid general laughter.

Pavel went over to the front rows and found Zharky. The two friends had a long chat in Pavel's room. Zharky told Pavel that he was working in the propaganda section of one of the Party's regional committees.

"You didn't know I was married, did you?" said Zharky. "I'm expecting a son or a daughter before long."

"Married, eh?" Pavel was surprised. "Who is your wife?"

Zharky took a photograph out of his pocket and showed it to Pavel.

"Recognise her?"

It was a photo of himself and Anna Borhart.

"What happened to Dubava?" Pavel asked in still greater surprise.

"He's in Moscow. He left the university after he was expelled from the Party. He's at the Bauman Technical Institute now. I hear he's been reinstated. Too bad, if it's true. He's rotten through and through. ... Guess what Pankratov is doing? He's assistant director of a shipyard. I don't know much about the others. We've lost touch lately. We all work in different parts of the country. But it's nice to get together occasionally and recall the old times."

Dora came in bringing several other people with her. She glanced at the decoration on Zharky's jacket and asked Pavel:

"Is your comrade a Party member? Where does he work?"

Puzzled, Pavel told her briefly about Zharky.

"Good," she said. "Then he can remain. These comrades have just come from Moscow. They are going to give us the latest Party news. We decided to come to your room and hold a sort of closed Party meeting," she explained.

With the exception of Pavel and Zharky all the newcomers were old Bolsheviks. Bartashev, a member of the Moscow Control Commission, told them about the new opposition headed by Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev.

"At this critical moment we ought to be at our posts," Bartashev said in conclusion. "I am leaving tomorrow."

Three days after that meeting in Pavel's room the sanatorium was deserted. Pavel too left shortly afterward, before his time was up.

The Central Committee of the Komsomol did not detain him. He was given an appointment as Komsomol Secretary in one of the industrial regions, and within a week he was already addressing a meeting of the local town organisation.

Late that autumn the car in which Pavel was travelling with two other Party workers to one of the remote districts, skidded into a ditch and overturned.

All the occupants were injured. Pavel's right knee was crushed. A few days later he was taken to the surgical institute in Kharkov. After an examination and X-ray of the injured limb the medical commission advised an immediate operation.

Pavel gave his consent.

"Tomorrow morning then," said the stout professor, who headed the commission. He got up and the others filed out after him.

A small bright ward with a single cot. Spotless cleanliness and the peculiar hospital smell he had long since forgotten. He glanced about him. Beside the cot stood a small table covered with a snow-white cloth and a white-painted stool. And that was all.

The nurse brought in his supper. Pavel sent it back. Half-sitting in his bed, he was writing letters.

The pain in his knee interfered with his thoughts and robbed him of his appetite.

When the fourth letter had been written the door opened softly and a young woman in a white smock and cap came over to his bed.

In the twilight he made out a pair of arched eyebrows and large eyes that seemed black. In one hand she held a portfolio, in the other, a sheet of paper and a pencil.

"I am your ward doctor," she said. "Now I am going to ask you a lot of questions and you will have to tell me all about yourself, whether you like it or not."

She smiled pleasantly and her smile took the edge off her "cross-examination". Pavel spent the better part of an hour telling her not only about himself but about all his relatives several generations back.

... The operating theatre. People with gauze masks over noses and mouths. Shining nickel instruments, a long narrow table with a huge basin beneath it.

The professor was still washing his hands when Pavel lay down on the operating table. Behind him swift preparations were being made for the operation. He turned his head. The nurse was laying out pincets and lancets.

"Don't look, Comrade Korchagin," said Bazhanova, his ward doctor, who was unbandaging his leg. "It is bad for the nerves."

"For whose nerves, doctor?" Pavel asked with a mocking smile.

A few minutes later a heavy mask covered his face and he heard the professor's voice saying:

"We are going to give you an anaesthetic. Now breathe in deeply through your nose and begin counting."

"Very well," a calm voice muffled by the mask replied. "I apologise in advance for any unprintable remarks I am liable to make."

The professor could not suppress a smile.

The first drops of ether. The suffocating loathsome smell.

Pavel took a deep breath and making an effort to speak distinctly began counting. The curtain had risen on the first act of his tragedy.

Artem tore open the envelope and trembling inwardly unfolded the letter. His eyes bored into the first few lines, then ran quickly over the rest of the page.

"Artem! We write to each other so seldom, once, or at best twice a year! But is it quantity that matters? You write that you and your family have moved from Shepetovka to Kazatin railway yards because you wished to tear up your roots. I know that those roots lie in the backward, petty-proprietor psychology of Styosha and her relatives. It is hard to remake people of Styosha's type,and I am very much afraid you will not succeed. You say you are finding it hard to study 'in your old age', yet you seem to be doing not so badly. You are wrong in your stubborn refusal to leave the factory and take up work as Chairman of the Town Soviet. You fought for the Soviet power,didn't you? Then take it! Take over the Town Soviet tomorrow and get to work!

"Now about myself. Something is seriously wrong with me. I have become a far too frequentinmate in hospitals. They have cut me up twice. I have lost quite a bit of blood and strength, but nobody can tell me yet when it will all end.

"I am no longer fit for work. I have acquired a new profession, that of 'invalid'. I am enduring much pain, and the net result of all this is loss of movement in the joint of my right knee, several scars in various parts of my body, and now the latest medical discovery: seven years ago I injured my spine and now I am told that this injury may cost me dearly. But I am ready to endure anything so long as I can return to the ranks.

"There is nothing more terrible to me in life than to fall out of the ranks. That is a possibility I refuse to contemplate. And that is why I let them do anything they like with me. But there is no improvement and the clouds grow darker and thicker all the time. After the first operation I returned to work as soon as I could walk, but before long they brought me back again. Now I am being sent to a sanatorium in Yevpatoria. I leave tomorrow. But don't be downhearted, Artem, you know I don't give in easily. I have life enough in me for three. You and I will do some good work yet, brother. Now take care of your health, don't try to overtax your strength, because health repairs cost the Party far too much. All the experience we gain in work, and the knowledge we acquire by study is far too precious to be wasted in hospitals. I shake your hand.

"Pavel."

While Artem, his heavy brows knitted, was reading his brother's letter, Pavel was taking leave of Dr. Bazhanova in the hospital.

"So you are leaving for the Crimea tomorrow?" she said as she gave him her hand. "How are you going to spend the rest of the day?"

"Comrade Rodkina is coming here soon," Pavel replied. "She is taking me to her place to meet her family. I shall spend the night there and tomorrow she will take me to the station."

Bazhanova knew Dora for she had often visited Pavel in the hospital.

"But, Comrade Korchagin, have you forgotten your promise to let my father see you before you go? I have given him a detailed account of your illness and I should like him to examine you.

Perhaps you could manage it this evening."

Pavel agreed at once.

That evening Bazhanova showed Pavel into her father's spacious office.

The famous surgeon gave Pavel a careful examination. His daughter had brought all the X-ray pictures and analyses from the clinic. Pavel could not help noticing how pale she turned when her father made some lengthy remark in Latin. Pavel stared at the professor's large bald head bent over him and searched his keen eyes, but Bazhanov's expression was inscrutable.

When Pavel had dressed, the professor took leave of him cordially, explaining that he was due at a conference, and left his daughter to inform Pavel of the result of his examination.

Pavel lay on the couch in Bazhanova's tastefully furnished room waiting for the doctor to speak. But she did not know how to begin. She could not bring herself to repeat what her father had told her — that medicine was so far unable to check the disastrous inflammatory process at work in Pavel's organism. The professor had been opposed to an operation. "This young man is fated to lose the use of his limbs and we are powerless to avert the tragedy."

She did not consider it wise either as doctor or friend to tell him the whole truth and so in carefully chosen words she told him only part of the truth.

"I am certain, Comrade Korchagin, that the Yevpatoria mud will put you right and that by autumn you will be able to return to work."

But she had forgotten that his sharp eye had been watching her all the time.

"From what you say, or rather from what you have not said, I see that the situation is grave.

Remember I asked you always to be perfectly frank with me. You need not hide anything from me, I shan't faint or try to cut my throat. But I very much want to know what is in store for me."

Bazhanova evaded a direct answer by making some cheerful remark and Pavel did not learn the truth about his future that night.

"Do not forget that I am your friend, Comrade Korchagin," the doctor said softly in parting. "Who knows what life has in store for you. If ever you need my help or my advice please write to me. I shall do everything in my power to help you."

Through the window she watched the tall leather-clad figure, leaning heavily on a stick, move painfully from the door to the waiting cab.

Yevpatoria again. The hot southern sun. Noisy sunburned people in embroidered skullcaps. A ten-minute drive brought the new arrivals to a two-storey grey limestone building — the Mainak Sanatorium.

The doctor on duty, learning that Pavel's accommodation had been reserved by the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, took him up to room No. 11.

"I shall put you in with Comrade Ebner. He is a German and he has asked for a Russian roommate," he explained as he knocked at the door. A voice with a heavy German accent sounded from within. "Come in."

Pavel put down his travelling bag and turned to the fair-haired man with the lively blue eyes who was lying on the bed. The German met him with a warm smile.

"Guten Morgen, Genosse. I mean, good day," he corrected himself, stretching a pale, long-fingered hand to Pavel.

A few moments later Pavel was sitting by his bed and the two were engrossed in a lively conversation in that "international language" in which words play a minor role, and imagination,gestures and mimicry, all the media of the unwritten Esperanto, fill in the gaps.

Pavel learned that Ebner was a German worker who had been wounded in the hip during the Hamburg uprising of 1923. The old wound had re-opened and he was confined to his bed. But hebore his sufferings cheerfully and that won Pavel's respect for him at once.

Pavel could not have wished for a better room-mate. This one would not talk about his ailments from morning till night and bemoan his lot. On the contrary, with him one could forget one's own troubles.

"Too bad I don't know any German, though," Pavel thought ruefully.

In a corner of the sanatorium grounds stood several rocking-chairs, a bamboo table and two bath-chairs. It was here that the five patients whom the others referred to as the "Executive of the Comintern" were in the habit of spending their time after the day's medical treatments were over.

Ebner half reclined in one of the bath-chairs. Pavel, who had also been forbidden to walk, in the other. The three other members of the group were Weiman, a thickset Estonian, who worked at a Republican Commissariat of Trade, Marta Laurin, a young, brown-eyed Lettish woman wholooked like a girl of eighteen, and Ledenev, a tall, powerfully-built Siberian with greying temples.

This small group indeed represented five different nationalities — German, Estonian, Lettish,Russian and Ukrainian. Marta and Weiman spoke German and Ebner used them as interpreters.

Pavel and Ebner were friends because they shared the same room; Marta, Weiman and Ebner, because they shared a common language. The bond between Ledenev and Korchagin was chess. 

Before Ledenev arrived, Korchagin had been the sanatorium chess "champion". He had won the title from Weiman after a stiff struggle. The phlegmatic Estonian had been somewhat shaken by his defeat and for a long time he could not forgive Korchagin for having worsted him. But one day a tall man, looking remarkably young for his fifty years, turned up at the sanatorium and suggested a game of chess with Korchagin. Pavel, having no inkling of danger, calmly began with a Queen's Gambit, which Ledenev countered by advancing his central pawns. As "champion", Pavel was obliged to play all new arrivals, and there was always a knot of interested spectators around the board. After the ninth move Pavel realised that his opponent was cramping him by steadily advancing his pawns. Pavel saw now that he had a dangerous opponent and began to regret that he had treated the game so lightly at the start. 

After a three-hour struggle during which Pavel exerted all his skill and ingenuity he was obliged to give up. He foresaw his defeat long before any of the onlookers. He glanced up at his opponent and saw Ledenev looking at him with a kindly smile. It was clear that he too saw how the game would end. The Estonian, who was following the game tensely and making no secret of his desire to see Korchagin defeated, was still unaware of what was happening. 

"I always hold out to my last pawn," Pavel said, and Ledenev nodded approvingly. 

Pavel played ten games with Ledenev in five days, losing seven, winning two and drawing one. 

Weiman was jubilant. 

"Thank you, Comrade Ledenev, thank you! That was a wonderful thrashing you gave him! He deserved it! He knocked out all of us old chess players and now he's been paid back by an old man himself. Ha! Ha!" 

"How does it feel to be the loser, eh?" he teased the now vanquished victor. 

Pavel lost the title of "champion" but won in Ledenev a friend who was later to become very precious to him. He saw now that his defeat on the chessboard was only to have been expected. His knowledge of chess strategy had been purely superficial and he had lost to an expert who knew all the secrets of the game. 

Korchagin and Ledenev found that they had one important date in common: Pavel was born the year Ledenev joined the Party. Both were typical representatives of the young and old guard of Bolsheviks. The one had behind him a long life of intensive political activity, years of work in the underground movement and tsarist imprisonment, followed by important government work; the other had his flaming youth and only eight years of struggle, but years that could have burnt up more than one life. And both of them, the old man and the young, were avid of life and broken in health. 

In the evenings the room shared by Ebner and Korchagin became a sort of club. All the political news emanated from here. The room rang with laughter and talk. Weiman usually tried to insert a bawdy anecdote into the conversation but invariably found himself attacked from two sides, by Marta and Korchagin. As a rule Marta was able to restrain him by some sharp sarcastic remark, but when this did not help Korchagin would intervene. 

"Your particular brand of 'humour' is not exactly to our taste, you know, Weiman," Marta would say. 

"I can't understand how you can stoop to that sort of thing," Korchagin would begin.

Weiman would stick out his thick underlip and survey the gathering with a mocking glint in his small eyes. 

"We shall have to set up a department of morals under the Political Enlightenment Department and recommend Korchagin as chief inspector. I can understand why Marta objects, she is the professional feminine opposition, but Korchagin is just trying to pose as a young innocent, a sort of Komsomol babe-in-arms. . . . What's more, I object to the egg trying to teach the hen." 

After one heated debate on the question of communist ethics, the matter of obscene jokes was discussed from the standpoint of principle. Marta translated to Ebner the various views expressed. 

"Die erotische Anekdote" he said, "is no good. I agree with Pavel." 

Weiman was obliged to retreat. He laughed the matter off as best he could, but told no more smutty stories. 

Pavel had taken Marta for a Komsomol member, judging her to be no more than nineteen. He was much surprised when he learned that she had been in the Party since 1917, that she was thirty-one and an active member of the Latvian Communist Party. In 1918 the Whites had sentenced her to be shot, but she had eventually been turned over to the Soviet Government along with some other comrades in an exchange of prisoners. She was now working on the editorial staff of the Pravda and taking a university course at the same time. 

Before Pavel was aware of it, a friendship sprang up between them, and the little Lettish woman who often dropped in to see Ebner, became an inseparable member of the "five". Eglit, a Latvian underground worker, liked to tease her on this score. "What about poor Ozol pining away at home in Moscow? Oh Marta, how can you?" 

Every morning, just before the bell to rise sounded, a lusty cockcrow would ring out over the sanatorium. The puzzled attendants would run hither and thither in search of the errant bird. It never occurred to them that Ebner, who could give a perfect imitation of a cockcrow, was having a little joke at their expense. Ebner enjoyed himself immensely. 

Toward the end of his month's stay in the sanatorium Pavel's condition took a turn for the worse. 

The doctors ordered him to bed. Ebner was much upset. He had grown very fond of this courageous young Bolshevik, so full of life and energy, who had lost his health so early in life. 

And when Marta told him of the tragic future the doctors predicted for Korchagin, Ebner was deeply distressed. 

Pavel was confined to his bed for the remainder of his stay in the sanatorium. He managed to hide his suffering from those around him, and Marta alone guessed by his ghastly pallor that he must be in pain. A week before his departure Pavel received a letter from the Ukrainian Central Committee informing him that his leave had been prolonged for two months on the advice of the sanatorium doctors who declared him unfit for work. Money to cover his expenses arrived along with the letter. 

Pavel took this first blow as years before during his boxing lessons he had taken Zhukhrai's punches. Then too he had fallen only to rise again at once. 

A letter came from his mother asking him to go and see an old friend of hers, Albina Kyutsam, who lived in a small port town not far from Yevpatoria. Pavel's mother had not seen her friend for fifteen years and she begged him to pay her a visit while he was in the Crimea. This letter was to play an important role in Pavel's life. 

A week later his sanatorium friends gave him a warm send-off at the pier. Ebner embraced him and kissed him like a brother. Marta was away at the time and Pavel left without saying good-bye to her. 

The next morning the horse cab which brought Pavel from the pier drove up to a little house fronted by a small garden. 

The Kyutsam family consisted of five people: Albina the mother, a plump elderly woman with dark, mournful eyes and traces of beauty on her aging face, her two daughters, Lola and Taya, Lola's little son, and old Kyutsam, the head of the house, a burly, unpleasant old man resembling a boar. 

Old Kyutsam worked in a co-operative store. Taya, the younger girl, did any odd job that came along, and Lola, who had been a typist, had recently separated from her husband, a drunkard and a bully, and now stayed at home to look after her little boy and help her mother with the housework. 

Besides the two daughters, there was a son named George, who was away in Leningrad at the time of Pavel's arrival. 

The family gave Pavel a warm welcome. Only the old man eyed the visitor with hostility and suspicion. 

Pavel patiently told Albina all the family news, and in his turn learned a good deal about the life of the Kyutsams. 

Lola was twenty-two. A simple girl, with bobbed brown hair and a broad-featured, open face, she at once took Pavel into her confidence and initiated him into all the family secrets. She told him that the old man ruled the whole family with a despotic hand, suppressing the slightest manifestation of independence on the part of the others. Narrow-minded, bigoted and captious, he kept the family in a permanent state of terror. This had earned him the deep dislike of his children and the hatred of his wife who had fought vainly against his despotism for twenty-five years. The girls always took their mother's side. These incessant family quarrels were poisoning their lives. 

Days passed in endless bickering and strife. 

Another source of family trouble, Lola told Pavel, was her brother George, a typical good-fornothing, boastful, arrogant, caring for nothing but good food, strong drink and smart clothes. 

When he finished school, George, who had been his mother's favourite, announced that he was going to the university and demanded money for the trip. 

"Lola can sell her ring and you've got some things you can raise money on too. I need the money and I don't care how you get it." 

George knew very well that his mother would refuse him nothing and he shamelessly took advantage of her affection for him. He looked down on his sisters. The mother sent her son all the money she could wheedle out of her husband, and whatever Taya earned besides. In the meantime George, having flunked the entrance examinations, had a pleasant time in Leningrad staying with his uncle and terrorising his mother by frequent telegraphic demands for more money. 

Pavel did not meet Taya until late in the evening of his arrival. Her mother hurried out to meet her in the hallway and Pavel heard her whispering the news of his coming. The girl shook hands shyly with the strange young man, blushing to the tips of her small ears, and Pavel held her strong, calloused little hand for a few moments before releasing it. 

Taya was in her nineteenth year. She was not beautiful, yet with her large brown eyes, and her slanting, Mongolian brows, fine nose and full fresh lips she was very attractive. Her firm young breasts stood out under her striped blouse.

The sisters had two tiny rooms to themselves. In Taya's room there was a narrow iron cot, a chest of drawers covered with knick-knacks, a small mirror, and dozens of photographs and postcards on the walls. On the windowsill stood two flower pots with scarlet geraniums and pale pink asters.

The lace curtain was caught up by a pale blue ribbon.

"Taya does not usually admit members of the male sex to her room. She is making an exception for you," Lola teased her sister.

The next evening the family was seated at tea in the old couple's half of the house. Kyutsam stirred his tea busily, casting hostile glances over his spectacles at the visitor."I don't think much of the marriage laws nowadays," he said. "Married one day, unmarried the next. Just as you please. Complete freedom."

The old man choked and spluttered. When he recovered his breath he pointed to Lola.

"Look at her, she and that fine fellow of hers got married without asking anyone's permission and separated the same way. And now it's me who's got to feed her and her brat. An outrage I call it!" Lola blushed painfully and hid her tear-filled eyes from Pavel.

"So you think she ought to live with that scoundrel?" Pavel asked, his eyes flashing.

"She should have known whom she was marrying."

Albina intervened. Barely repressing her wrath, she said quickly: "Why must you discuss such things before a stranger? Can't you find anything else to talk about?"

The old man turned and pounced on her:

"I know what I'm talking about! Since when have you begun to tell me what to do!"

That night Pavel lay awake for a long time thinking about the Kyutsams. Brought here by chance,he had unwittingly become a participant in this family drama. He wondered how he could help the mother and daughters to free themselves from this bondage. His own life was far from settled,many problems remained to be solved and it was harder than ever before to take resolute action.

There was clearly but one way out: the family had to break up, the mother and daughters must leave the old man. But this was not so simple. Pavel was in no position to undertake this family revolution, for he was due to leave in a few days and he might never see these people again. Was it not better to let things take their course instead of trying to stir these turbid backwaters? But the repulsive image of the old man gave him no rest. Several plans occurred to Pavel but on second thoughts he discarded them all as impracticable.

The next day was Sunday and when Pavel returned from a walk in town he found Taya alone at home. The others were out visiting relatives.

Pavel went to her room and dropped wearily onto a chair.

"Why don't you ever go out and enjoy yourself?" he asked her.

"I don't want to go anywhere," she replied in a low voice.

He remembered the plans he had thought of during the night and decided to put them before her.

Speaking quickly so as to finish before the others returned, he went straight to the point.

"Listen, Taya, you and I are good friends. Why should we stand on ceremony with each other? I am going away soon. It is a pity that I should have come to know your family just at the time when I myself am in trouble, otherwise things might have turned out differently. If this happened ayear ago we could all leave here together.

There is plenty of work everywhere for people like you and Lola. It's useless to expect the old man to change. The only way out is for you to leave home.

But that is impossible at present. I don't know yet what is going to happen to me. I am going to insist on being sent back to work. The doctors have written all sorts of nonsense about me and the comrades are trying to make me cure myself endlessly. But we'll see about that.... I shall write to mother and get her advice about your trouble here. I can't let things go on this way. But you must realise, Taya, that this will mean wrenching yourself loose from your present life. Would you want that, and would you have the strength to go through with it?" 

Taya looked up.

-"I do want it," she said softly. "As for the strength, I don't know."

Pavel could understand her uncertainty.

"Never mind, Taya! So long as the desire is there everything will be all right. Tell me, are you very much attached to your family?"

Taya hesitated for a moment.

"I am very sorry for mother," she said at last. "Father has made her life miserable and now George is torturing her. I'm terribly sorry for her, although she never loved me as much as she does George...."

" They had a long heart to heart talk. Shortly before the rest of the family returned, Pavel remarked jokingly:

"It's surprising the old man hasn't married you off to someone by now."

Taya threw up her hands in horror at the thought.

"Oh no, I'll never marry. I've seen what poor Lola has been through. I shan't get married for anything."

Pavel laughed.

"So you've settled the matter for the rest of your life? And what if some fine, handsome young fellow comes along, what then?"

"No, I won't. They're all fine while they're courting."

Pavel laid his hand conciliatingly on her shoulder.

"That's all right, Taya. You can get along quite well without a husband. But you needn't be so hard on the young men. It's a good thing you don't suspect me of trying to court you, or there'd be trouble," and he patted her arm in brotherly fashion.

"Men like you marry girls of a different sort," she said softly.

A few days later Pavel left for Kharkov. Taya, Lola and Albina with her sister Rosa came to the station to see him off. Albina made him promise not to forget her daughters and to help them all to find some way out of their plight. They took leave of him as of someone near and dear to them, and there were tears in Taya's eyes.

From the window of his carriage Pavel watched Lola's white kerchief and Taya's striped blouse grow smaller and smaller until they finally disappeared. 

In Kharkov he put up at his friend Petya Novikov's place, for he did not want to disturb Dora. As soon as he had rested from the journey he went to the Central Committee. There he waited for Akim, and when at last the two were alone, he asked to be sent at once to work. Akim shook his head. 

"Can't be done, Pavel! We have the decision of the Medical Commission and the Central Committee says your condition is serious. You're to be sent to the Neu-ropathological Institute for treatment and not to be permitted to work."

"What do I care what they say, Akim! I am appealing to you. Give me a chance to work! This moving about from one hospital to another is killing me." 

Akim tried to refuse. "We can't go against the decision. Don't you see it's for your own good, Pavel?" he argued. But Pavel pleaded his cause so fervently that Akim finally gave in. 

The very next day Pavel was working in the Special Department of the Central Committee Secretariat. He believed that he had only to begin working for his lost strength to return to him. 

But he soon saw that he had been mistaken. He sat at his desk for eight hours at a stretch without pausing for lunch simply because the effort of going down three flights of stairs to the canteen across the way was too much for him. Very often his hand or his leg would suddenly go numb, and at times his whole body would be paralysed for a few moments. He was nearly always feverish. On some mornings he found himself unable to rise from his bed, and by the time the attack passed, he realised in despair that he would be a whole hour late for work. Finally the day came when he was officially reprimanded for reporting late for work and he saw that this was the beginning of what he dreaded most in life — he was falling out of the ranks. 

Twice Akim helped him by shifting him to other work, but the inevitable happened. A month after his return to work he was confined to his bed again. It was then that he remembered Bazhanova's parting words. He wrote to her and she came the same day. She told him what he had wanted to know: that hospitalisation was not imperative. 

"So I don't need any more treatment? That's fine!" he said cheerfully, but the joke fell flat. As soon as he felt a little stronger he went back to the Central

Committee. This time Akim was adamant. He insisted on Pavel's going to the hospital. 

"I'm not going," Pavel said wearily. "It's useless. I have it on excellent authority. There is only one thing left for me — to retire on pension. But that I shall

never do! You can't make me give up my work. I am only twenty-four and I'm not going to be a labour invalid for the rest of my life, moving from hospital to hospital, knowing that it won't do me any good. You must give me something to do, some work suitable to my condition. I can work at home, or I can live in the office. Only don't give me any paper work. I've got to have work that will give me the satisfaction of knowing that I can still be useful." 

Pavel's voice, vibrant with emotion, rose higher and higher. 

Akim felt keenly for Pavel. He knew what a tragedy it was for this passionate-hearted youth, who had given the whole of his short life to the Party, to be torn from the ranks and doomed to a life far from the battlefront. He resolved to do all he could to help him. 

"All right, Pavel, calm yourself. There will be a meeting of the Secretariat tomorrow and I'll put your case before the comrades. I promise to do all I can." 

Pavel rose heavily and seized Akim's hand. 

"Do you really think, Akim, that life can drive me into a corner and crush me? So long as my heart beats here" — and he pressed Akim's hand to his chest so that he could feel the dull pounding of his heart — "so long as it beats, no one will be able to tear me away from the Party. Death alone can put me out of the ranks. Remember that, my friend." 

Akim said nothing. He knew that this was not an empty phrase. It was the cry of a soldier mortally wounded in battle. He knew that men like Korchagin could not speak or feel otherwise. 

Two days later Akim told Pavel that he was to be given an opportunity to work on the staff of a big newspaper, provided, of course, it was found that he could be used for literary work. Pavel was courteously received at the editorial office and was interviewed by the assistant editor, an old Party worker, and member of the Presidium of the Central Control Committee of the Ukraine. 

"What education have you had, Comrade?" she asked him. 

"Three years of elementary school." 

"Have you been to any of the Party political schools?" 

"No." 

"Well, one can be a good journalist without all that. Comrade Akim has told us about you. We can give you work to do at home, and in general, we are prepared to provide you with suitable conditions for work. True, work of this kind requires considerable knowledge. Particularly in the sphere of literature and language." 

This was by no means encouraging. The half-hour interview showed Pavel that his knowledge was inadequate, and the trial article he wrote was returned to him with some three dozen stylistic and spelling mistakes marked in red pencil. 

"You have considerable ability, Comrade Korchagin," said the editor, "and with some hard work you might learn to write quite well. But at the present time your grammar is faulty. Your article shows that you do not know the Russian language well enough. That is not surprising considering that you have had no time to learn it.

Unfortunately we can't use you, although as I said before, you have ability. If your article were edited, without altering the contents, it would be excellent. 

But, you see, we haven't enough editors as it is." 

Korchagin rose, leaning heavily on his stick. His right eyebrow twitched. 

"Yes, I see your point. What sort of a journalist would I make? I was a good stoker once, and not a bad electrician. I rode a horse well, and I knew how to stir up the Komsomol youth, but I can see I would cut a sorry figure on your front." 

He shook hands and left. 

At a turning in the corridor he stumbled and would have fallen had he not been caught by a woman who happened to be passing by. 

"What's the matter, Comrade? You look quite ill!" 

It took Pavel several seconds to recover. Then he gently released himself and walked on, leaning heavily on his stick. 

From that day Pavel felt that his life was on the decline. Work was now out of the question. More and more often he was confined to his bed. The Central Committee released him from work and arranged for his pension. In due time the pension came together with the certificate of a labour invalid. The Central Committee gave him money and issued him his papers, giving him the right to go wherever he wished. 

He received a letter from Marta inviting him to come to visit her in Moscow and have a rest. Pavel had intended going to Moscow in any case, for he cherished the dim hope that the All-Union Central Committee would help him to find work that would not require moving around. But in Moscow too he was advised to take medical treatment and offered accommodation in a good hospital. He refused. 

The nineteen days spent in the flat Marta shared with her friend Nadya Peterson flew quickly by. 

Pavel was left a great deal to himself, for the two young women left the house in the morning for work and did not return till evening. Pavel spent his time reading books from Marta's well-stocked library. The evenings passed pleasantly in the company of the girls and their friends.

Letters came from the Kyutsams inviting him to come and visit them. Life there was becoming unendurable and his help was wanted. 

And so one morning Korchagin left the quiet little flat on Gusyatnikov Street. The train bore him swiftly south to the sea, away from the damp rainy autumn to the warm shores of the southern Crimea. He sat at the window watching the telegraph poles fly past. His brows were knit and there was an obstinate gleam in his dark eyes.

　　中央委员会“公社战士”疗养院的旁边，是中心医院的大花园。疗养院的人从海滨回来，都从这座花园经过。花园的一堵灰色石头砌的高墙附近，长着枝叶茂盛的法国梧桐，保尔喜欢在这里的树荫下休息。这个地方很少有人来。从这里可以观看花园林荫道和小径上络绎不绝的行人；晚上，又可以远远避开大疗养区恼人的喧闹，在这里静听音乐。

　　今天，保尔又躲到这个角落里来了。他舒适地在一张藤摇椅上躺下，海水浴和日光浴使他疲乏了，他打起瞌睡来。一条厚毛巾和一本没有看完的富尔曼诺夫的小说《叛乱》，放在旁边的摇椅上。到疗养院的最初几天，他仍然处在神经过敏的紧张状态中，头疼的症状始终没有消失。教授们一直在研究他那复杂而罕见的病情。一次又一次的叩诊、听诊，使他感到又腻烦，又疲劳。责任医生是一个大家都愿意接近的女党员，姓耶路撒冷奇克，这个姓很怪。她总要费很大劲，才能找到她的这个病人，然后又耐着性子劝他一起去找这位专家或者那位专家。

　　“说实在的，这一套真叫我烦透了。”保尔说。“同样的问题，一天得回答他们五遍。什么您的祖母是不是疯子啊，什么您的曾祖父得没得过风湿病啊，鬼才知道他得过什么病，我压根儿就没见过他。而且，他们每个人都想叫我承认得过淋病，或者别的什么更糟糕的病。老实说，为了这个我真想敲敲他们的秃脑袋。还是让我休息一会儿吧！要是这一个半月老这么把我研究来研究去，我就要变成一个社会危害分子了。”

　　耶路撒冷奇克总是笑着，用玩笑回答他，过不了几分钟，她已经挽着他的胳膊，一路上说着有趣的事，把他领到外科医生那里去了。

　　今天看样子不会检查了。离吃午饭还有一个小时。保尔在矇眬的睡意中听到了脚步声。他没有睁开眼睛，心想：“也许以为我睡着了，就会走开的。”但是，希望落空了，摇椅嘎吱响了一声，有人坐了下来。飘过来一股清淡的香气，说明坐在旁边的是个女人。保尔睁开眼睛。首先映入他眼帘的是耀眼的白色连衣裙，两条晒得黝黑的腿和两只穿着羊皮便鞋的脚，然后是留着男孩发式的头，两只大眼睛，一排细小的牙齿。她不好意思地笑了笑，说：“对不起，我大概打搅您了吧？”

　　保尔没有做声。这可有点不礼貌，不过他还是希望这个女人会走开。

　　“这是您的书吗？”

　　她翻弄着《叛乱》。

　　“是我的……”

　　又是一阵沉默。

　　“同志，请问您是‘公社战士’疗养院的吗？”

　　保尔不耐烦地扭了一下。“打哪儿冒出来这么个人？这算什么休息？说不定马上还要问我得的是什么病呢。算了，我还是走吧。”于是他生硬地回答：“不是。”

　　“可我好像在哪儿见过您。”

　　保尔已经抬起身子，背后忽然传来一个女人的响亮的声音。

　　“你怎么钻到这儿来了，朵拉？”

　　一个晒得黝黑、体态丰满的金发女人，穿着疗养院的浴衣，在摇椅边上坐了下来。她瞥了保尔一眼。

　　“同志，我好像在哪儿见过您。您是不是在哈尔科夫工作？”

　　“是的，是在哈尔科夫。”

　　“做什么工作？”

　　保尔决心结束这场没完没了的谈话，便回答说：“掏茅房的！”

　　她们听了哈哈大笑，保尔不由得哆嗦了一下。

　　“同志，您这种态度，恐怕不能说很有礼貌吧。”

　　他们的友谊就是这样开始的。哈尔科夫市党委常委朵拉·罗德金娜后来不止一次回忆起他们结识时的可笑情景。

　　一天午饭后，保尔到海洋疗养院的花园去看歌舞演出，没想到在这里遇见了扎尔基。说来也怪，使他们相逢的竟是一场狐步舞。

　　一个肥胖的歌女，狂荡地打着手势，唱完了一支《良夜销魂曲》。随后，一男一女跳上了舞台。男的头上戴一顶红色圆筒高帽，半裸着身体，胯骨周围系着五颜六色的扣带，上身却穿着白得刺眼的胸衣，还扎着领带。一句话，装的是野蛮人，看起来却不伦不类。那女的长相倒不错，身上挂着许多布条。他们刚出场，一群站在疗养员的安乐椅和躺床后面的新经济政策暴发户，就伸出他们的牛脖子，齐声喝彩。这一对宝贝在他们的喝彩声中，扭动屁股，踏着碎步，在舞台上跳起了狐步舞。简直难以想象还有比这更加令人作呕的场面了。戴着傻瓜圆筒帽的胖汉子和那个女人，紧紧贴在一起，扭来扭去，做出各种下流猥亵的姿势。保尔身后，一个肥猪似的大胖子乐得呼哧呼哧直喘气。保尔刚要转身走开，紧靠舞台的前排有一个人站了起来，愤怒地喊道：“够了，别卖淫了！见鬼去吧！”

　　保尔认出这个人是扎尔基。

　　钢琴伴奏中断了，小提琴尖叫了一声，不再响了。台上的一对男女停止了扭摆。暴发户们从椅子后面发出一片嘘声，气势汹汹地指责方才喊叫的人：“把一出好戏给搅黄了，真他妈的不像话！”

　　“整个欧洲都在跳啊！”

　　“简直岂有此理！”

　　这时候，在“公社战士”疗养院来的一群观众里，共青团切列波韦茨县委书记谢廖沙·日巴诺夫把四个手指夹进嘴里，打了一个绿林好汉式的唿哨，别的人也群起响应。于是，台上那一对宝贝像被风刮走似的不见了。报幕的小丑像一个机灵的堂倌，跑出来向观众宣布，他们的歌舞班子马上就走。

　　“一条大道朝天，夹起尾巴滚蛋，要是爷爷问你，就说到莫斯科看看！”一个穿疗养衣的小伙子，在一片哄笑声中这样喊着，把报幕人送下了舞台。

　　保尔跑到前排，找到了扎尔基。他们在保尔房间里坐了很久。扎尔基在一个专区的党委会负责宣传鼓动工作。

　　“告诉你，我已经结婚了。很快就要抱孩子了。”扎尔基说。

　　“是吗，你爱人是谁？”保尔惊奇地问。

　　扎尔基从上衣口袋里掏出一张相片给保尔看。

　　“还认得出来吗？”

　　这是他和安娜·博哈特的合影。

　　“那杜巴瓦哪儿去了呢？”保尔更加惊讶了，又问。

　　“上莫斯科了。被开除出党以后，他就离开了共产主义大学，现在在莫斯科高等技校学习。听说他恢复了党籍。白搭！这个人是不可救药了……你知道潘克拉托夫在哪儿吗？他现在当了造船厂副厂长。其他人的情况我就不太清楚了，大家都不通音信。咱们分散在各地，能够碰到一起，谈谈过去的事，真叫人高兴。”扎尔基说。

　　朵拉走进保尔的房间，同她一起进来的还有几个人。一个高个子的坦波夫人关上了门。朵拉看了看扎尔基胸前的勋章，问保尔：“你的这位同志是党员吗？他在哪儿工作？”

　　保尔不明白是怎么回事，把扎尔基的情况简单地介绍了一下。

　　“那就让他留下吧。刚才从莫斯科来了几位同志。他们要给咱们讲一讲党内最近的一些情况。我们决定在你屋里开个会，算是个内部会议吧。”朵拉解释说。

　　在场的人，除了保尔和扎尔基之外，几乎全是老布尔什维克。莫斯科市监委委员巴尔塔绍夫，矮墩墩的个子，五十上下年纪，过去在乌拉尔地区当翻砂工人，他先发言，声音不大：“是的，有事实为证，出了新的反对派，我们原先就有预感，果然发生了。新反对派的领袖人物，除了季诺维也夫和加米涅夫，还有一个，不是别人，正是托洛茨基。他们狼狈为奸，相互打气。如今这个各色反对派拼凑起来的大杂烩开始行动了。”

　　坦波夫来的检察员插进来说：“第十四次代表大会上我就对同志们说过：‘你们记住我的话吧，季诺维也夫、加米涅夫早晚要同托洛茨基结亲。’当时，季诺维也夫带着一帮列宁格勒代表一个劲儿反对代表大会，托洛茨基一声不吭，净在一边看热闹，心里则在寻思：‘你们这帮狗崽子，因为‘十月革命的教训’一直在攻击我，要把我置之死地，如今自己滑进了同一个泥坑。’有人不同意我的看法，说季诺维也夫和加米涅夫多年来都在跟托洛茨基主义作斗争，在各个转折关头都谴责托洛茨基主义是党内异己派别，他们决不会背叛布尔什维主义，决不会听命于他们长期激烈批判过的人。

　　“结果怎么样呢？昨天的敌人、思想上的对头今天成了朋友，因为他们都在不择手段地反对布尔什维克党中央，同谁联合都行，牺牲自己的全部原则、放弃原先的立场也行。这些原则和立场如今在他们眼里粪土不如。同托洛茨基结盟会使他们过去布尔什维克的称号蒙上耻辱，可这算得了什么呢？

　　这个无原则的联盟很像一九一二年的八月联盟。不论是现在还是那个时候，挥舞指挥棒的都是托洛茨基。季诺维也夫和加米涅夫这次的表演，其卑鄙程度不亚于他们在十月武装起义前的畏缩。这号人，”坦波夫人瞥了一眼在座的女同胞朵拉，咽回去一句骂娘话。“呸，差点没说出脏话来！这种乱七八糟的事我还真没见过。”坦波夫人结束了他的发言。

　　“一切迹象表明，最近期间这个联合的反对派就会向党发动进攻。这些不断冒出来的小集团干的就是一件事——制造混乱，破坏党的统一。我不明白，我们什么时候才能把它们彻底了结。我们太放任太宽容他们了。依我看，应该把这些职业的捣乱分子和反对派一个一个通通清除出党。我们在跟这些反党分子的斗争上浪费了多少时间和精力。”朵拉激烈地说。

　　老人梅伊兹然默默地听完大家的发言，接着说：“朋友们，我们不能再耽搁，要赶紧回去。疗养院多住两天少住两天无所谓，在这样紧要的关头，我们必须坚守各自的岗位。我明天就动身。”

　　在保尔房间集会之后三天，疗养员都走光了。保尔也提前出了院。

　　保尔在团中央没有耽搁很久。他被派到一个工业专区去，担任共青团专区委员会书记。一个星期后，城里的共青团积极分子就听到了他的第一次讲话。

　　深秋的一天，保尔和两名工作人员乘专区党委会的汽车到离城很远的一个区去，汽车掉进路边的壕沟里，翻了车。

　　车上的人都受了重伤。保尔的右膝盖压坏了。几天以后，他被送到哈尔科夫外科学院。几个医生会诊，检查了他红肿的膝盖，看了爱克斯光片，主张立即动手术。

　　保尔同意了。

　　“那么就明天早晨做吧。”主持会诊的胖教授最后这样说，接着就起身走了。其他医生也都跟着走了出去。

　　一间明亮的单人小病室，一尘不染，散发着保尔久已淡忘的那种医院特有的气味。他向四周看了看。一只铺着白台布的床头柜，一张白凳子，这就是全部家具。

　　护理员送来了晚饭。

　　保尔谢绝了。他半躺在床上写信。伤腿疼得很厉害，影响思考，也不想吃东西。

　　写完第四封信的时候，病室的门轻轻地打开了。保尔看见一个穿白大褂、戴白帽的年轻女人走到他床前。

　　在薄暮中，保尔依稀看到她那两道描得细细的眉毛和一对似乎是黑色的大眼睛。她一手提着皮包，一手拿着纸和铅笔。

　　“我是您这个病室的责任医生，”她说。“今天我值班。现在我向您提一些问题，您呢，不管愿意不愿意，要把您的全部情况都告诉我。”

　　女医生亲切地笑了笑。这一笑，减轻了“审问”的不快。

　　保尔整整讲了一个小时，不仅讲了自己的情况，而且连祖宗三代都讲到了。

　　手术室里，几个人戴着大口罩。

　　镀镍的手术器械闪着银光，狭长的手术台下面放着一个大盆。保尔躺在手术台上的时候，教授已经快洗完手了。手术前的准备工作正在保尔身后紧张地进行着。保尔回头看了一下，护士在安放手术刀、镊子。责任医生巴扎诺娃给他解开腿上的绷带，轻声对他说：“柯察金同志，别往那边看，看了对神经有刺激。”

　　“您说的是谁的神经，大夫？”保尔不以为然地笑了笑。

　　几分钟以后，保尔的脸给蒙上了厚实的面罩，教授对他说：“不要紧张，现在就给您施行氯仿麻醉。请您深呼吸，用鼻子吸气，数数吧。”

　　面罩下传出了低沉而平静的声音：“好的，我保不住会说出不干不净的话来，那就事先请你们原谅了。”

　　教授忍不住笑了。

　　几滴氯仿麻醉剂，散发着一股令人窒息的难闻气味。

　　保尔深深地吸了一口气，开始数起数来，努力把数字说得清楚些。他的生活悲剧就这样揭开了第一幕。

　　阿尔焦姆差点把信封撕成两半。他打开信的时候，不知道为什么心情忐忑不安。眼睛一看到信的开头，他就急忙一口气读了下去：

　　阿尔焦姆！咱们很少通信。一年一次，最多也就是两次吧！但是，次数多少有什么关系呢？你来信说，为了同老根一刀两断，你已经转到卡扎京的机车库工作，带着全家离开了舍佩托夫卡。我明白你的意思，你说的老根就是斯捷莎和她一家的那种小私有者的落后心理，以及诸如此类的东西。改造斯捷莎这一类人是困难的，我担心你未必做得到。你说“上了年纪，学习有困难”，可是你学得并不坏嘛。让你脱产专做市苏维埃主席的工作，你坚决不干，这是不对的。你不是为夺取政权战斗过吗？那你就应该掌握政权。你应该明天就接手市苏维埃的工作，干起来。

　　现在谈谈我自己。我的情况有点不妙。经常住院，开了两次刀，流了不少血，体力也有很大消耗，而且谁也不告诉我，什么时候是个头。

　　我离开了工作，给自己找到了一种新的职业——当病号。

　　我忍受着种种痛苦，而结果呢，是右膝关节不能活动了，身上添了好几个刀口；另外，医生最近发现，我的脊梁骨七年前受过暗伤。现在他们说，这个伤可能要我付出极高的代价。

　　我准备忍受一切，只要能重新归队就行。

　　对我的生活来说，没有比掉队更可怕的事情了。我甚至连想都不敢想。正因为这样，我才承受一切，只是一直不见起色，相反，阴云越聚越浓。第一次手术过后，我刚能走动，就恢复了工作，但是很快又被送进了医院。刚才我拿到了叶夫帕托里亚的迈纳克疗养院的入院证，明天就动身。别难过，阿尔焦姆，要我进棺材并不那么容易。我的生命力顶三个人不成问题。咱们还能干一阵呢，哥哥！你要注意身体，别再一下扛十普特了。不然，以后党要付出很大的代价给你修理。

　　岁月给我们经验，学习给我们知识，而得到这一切，并不是为了到一个又一个医院去做客。握你的手。

　　保尔·柯察金

　　就在阿尔焦姆皱着两道浓眉，阅读弟弟来信的时候，保尔正在医院和巴扎诺娃告别。她把手伸给他，问：“您明天就动身到克里木去吗？今天您打算在哪儿过呢？”

　　保尔回答：“朵拉同志马上就来。今天白天和晚上我都在她家里，明天一早她送我上火车。”

　　巴扎诺娃认识朵拉，因为她常来看保尔。

　　“柯察金同志，咱们说过，您临走之前要同我父亲见一面，您还记得吗？我已经把您的病情详细地告诉他了。我很想让他给您检查一下。今天晚上就可以。”

　　保尔立即同意了。

　　当天晚上，巴扎诺娃把保尔领到她父亲宽敞的工作室里。

　　这位著名的外科专家给保尔做了详细检查。巴扎诺娃也在场，她从医院拿来了爱克斯光片和全部化验单。谈话中间，她父亲用拉丁语说了很长一段话，她听了之后，脸色顿时变得煞白，这不能不引起保尔的注意。他盯着教授那秃顶的大脑袋，想从他敏锐的目光中看出点什么来，但是巴扎诺夫教授不露声色，无法捉摸。

　　等保尔穿好衣服，巴扎诺夫客气地向他告别；他要去参加一个会议，嘱咐女儿把检查结果告诉保尔。

　　在巴扎诺娃那间陈设雅致的房间里，保尔靠在沙发上，等待她开口。但是她不知道从哪里说起，说些什么；她感到很为难。父亲告诉她，保尔体内的致命炎症正在发展，医学现在还无法控制。教授反对再做任何外科手术，他说：“这个年轻人面临着瘫痪的悲剧，我们却没有能力防止它。”

　　作为保尔的医生和朋友，巴扎诺娃觉得不能把这一切都和盘托出。她只是用谨慎的措词向他透露了一小部分真情。

　　“柯察金同志，我相信，叶夫帕托里亚的泥疗一定会使您的病出现转机。秋天您就可以工作了。”

　　但是她说这些话的时候，忘记了有一对敏锐的眼睛一直在注视着她。

　　“从您的话里，确切些说，是从您没明说的话里，我已经完全明白了我的病情的严重性。您该记得，我请求过您永远要对我实话实说。什么事情都不要瞒着我，我听了不会晕倒，也不会抹脖子。可是我非常想知道，我今后会怎么样。”保尔说。

　　巴扎诺娃说了句笑话，把话岔开了。

　　这天晚上，保尔到底还是没有了解到真实情况，不知道他的明天将会怎样。临分手的时候，巴扎诺娃轻声

Part Two Chapter 8
---

Down below, the sea broke on the jagged chaos of rock. A stiff dry breeze blowing from distant Turkey fanned his face. The harbour, protected from the sea by a concrete mole, thrust itself in an irregular arc into the shore-line. And overlooking it all were the tiny white cottages of the town's outskirts perched on the slopes of the mountain range which broke off abruptly at the sea. 

It was quiet here in the old park outside of the town. Yellow maple leaves floated slowly down onto its grass-grown paths. 

The old Persian cabby who had driven Pavel out here from town could not help asking as his strange fare alighted: 

"Why come here of all places? No young ladies, no amusements. Nothing but the jackals. . . . 

What will you do here? Better let me drive you back to town, mister tovarish!" 

Pavel paid him and the old man drove away. 

The park was indeed a wilderness. Pavel found a bench on a cliff overlooking the sea, and sat down, lifting his face to the now mild autumn sun. 

He had come to this quiet spot to think things over and consider what to do with his life. The time had come to review the situation and take some decision. 

His second visit to the Kyutsams had brought the family strife to a head. The old man on learning of his arrival had flown into a rage. It fell naturally to Korchagin to lead the resistance. The old man unexpectedly encountered a vigorous rebuff from his wife and daughters, and from the first day of Pavel's arrival the house split into two hostile camps. The door leading to the parents' half of the house was locked and one of the small side rooms was rented to Korchagin. Pavel paid the rent in advance and the old man was somewhat mollified by the arrangement; now that his daughters had cut themselves off from him he would no longer be expected to support them. 

For diplomatic reasons Albina remained with her husband. As for the old man, he kept strictly to his side of the house and avoided meeting the man he so heartily detested. But outside in the yard he made as much noise as possible to show that he was still the master. 

Before he went to work in the co-operative shop, old Kyutsam had earned his living by shoemaking and carpentry and had built himself a small workshop in the backyard.

To annoy his lodger, he shifted his work bench from the shed to a spot in the yard right under Pavel's window where he hammered furiously for hours on end, deriving a malicious satisfaction from the knowledge that he was interfering with Korchagin's reading. 

"Just you wait," he hissed to himself, "I'll get you out of here. .. ." 

Far away a steamer laid a small dark trail of smoke over the sea at the very horizon. A flock of gulls skimmed the waves with piercing cries.

Pavel, his chin resting in his hand, sat lost in thought. His whole life passed swiftly before his mind's eye, from his childhood to the present. How had these twenty-four years of his been lived? 

Worthily or unworthily? He went over them again, year by year, subjecting them to sober, impartial judgement, and he found to his immense relief that he had not done so badly with his life. Mistakes there had been, the mistakes of youth, and chiefly of ignorance. But in the stormy days of struggle for Soviet power he had been in the thick of the fighting and on the crimson banner of Revolution there were a few drops of his own life's blood. 

He had remained in the ranks until his strength had failed him. And now, struck down and unable to hold his place in the firing lines, there was nothing left for him but the field hospital. He remembered the time when they had stormed Warsaw and how, at the height of battle, one of the men had been hit. He fell to the ground under his horse's hooves. His comrades quickly bandaged his wounds, turned him over to the stretcher-bearers and sped onward in pursuit of the enemy. The squadron had not halted its advance for the sake of one fallen soldier. Thus it was in the fight for a great cause and thus it had to be. True, there were exceptions. He had seen legless machine-gunners on gun carriages in battle. These men had struck terror into the enemy's ranks, their guns had sown death and destruction, and their steel-like courage and unerring eye had made them the pride of their units. But such men were few. 

What was he to do now that defeat had overtaken him and there was no longer any hope of returning to the ranks? Had he not extracted from Bazhanova the admission that the future held even worse torment in store for him? What was to be done? The question was like a yawning abyss spreading at his feet. 

What was there to live for now that he had lost what he prized most — the ability to fight? How was he to justify his existence today and in the cheerless tomorrow?

How was he to fill his days? Exist merely to breathe, to eat and to drink? Remain a helpless bystander watching his comrades fight their way forward? Be a burden to the detachment? No, better to destroy his treacherous body! A bullet in the heart — and be done with it! A timely end to a life well lived. Who would condemn the soldier for putting himself out of his agony? 

He felt the flat body of his Browning in his pocket. His fingers closed over the grip, and slowly he drew out the weapon. 

"Who would have thought that you would come to this?" 

The muzzle stared back at him with cold contempt. Pavel laid the pistol on his knee and cursed bitterly. 

"Cheap heroics, my lad! Any fool can shoot himself. That is the easiest way out, the coward's way. 

You can always put a bullet through your head when life hits you too hard. But have you tried getting the better of life? Are you sure you have done everything you can to break out of the steel trap? Have you forgotten the fighting at Novograd-Volynsky when we went into the attack seventeen times in one day until finally, in spite of everything, we won through? Put away that gun and never breathe a word of this to anyone. Learn how to go on living when life becomes unbearable. Make your life useful." 

He got up and went down to the road. A passing mountaineer gave him a lift on his cart. When they reached town he got off and bought a newspaper and read the announcement of a meeting of the city Party group in the Demyan Bedny Club. It was very late when he returned home that night. He had made a speech at the meeting, little suspecting that it was the last he was ever to make at a large public gathering. 

Taya was still awake when he got home. She had been worried at Pavel's prolonged absence. 

What had happened to him? She remembered the grim, cold look she had observed that morning in his eyes, always so live and warm. He never liked to talk about himself, but she felt that he was under some severe mental strain. 

As the clock in her mother's room chimed two she heard the gate creak and, slipping on her jacket, she went to open the door. Lola, asleep in her own room, murmured restlessly as Taya passed her. 

"I was beginning to get worried," Taya whispered with relief when Pavel came in. 

"Nothing is going to happen to me as long as I live, Taya," he whispered. "Lola's asleep? I am not the least bit sleepy for some reason. I have something to tell you.

Let's go to your room so as not to wake Lola." 

Taya hesitated. It was very late. How could she let him come to her room at this late hour? What would mother think? But she could not refuse for fear of offending him.

What could he have to say to her, she wondered, as she led the way to her room. 

"This is how it is, Taya," Pavel began in a low voice. He sat down opposite her in the dimly-lighted room, so close that she could feel his breath. "Life takes such strange turns that you begin to wonder sometimes. I have had a bad time of it these past few days. I did not know how I could go on living. Life had never seemed so black. But today I held a meeting of my own private 'political bureau' and adopted a decision of tremendous importance. Don't be surprised at what I have to say." 

He told her what he had gone through in the past few months and much of what had passed through his mind during his visit to the park. 

"That is the situation. Now for the most important thing. The storm in this family is only beginning. We must get out of here into the fresh air and as far away from this hole as possible. 

We must start life afresh. Once I have taken a hand in this fight I'm going to see it through. Our life, yours and mine, is none too happy at present. I have decided to breathe some warmth into it. 

Do you know what I mean? Will you be my life's companion, my wife?" 

Taya was deeply moved by his confession, but these last words startled her. 

"I am not asking you for an answer tonight," he went on. "You must think it over carefully. I suppose you cannot understand how such things can be put so bluntly without the usual courting. 

But you and I have no need of all that nonsense. I give you my hand, little girl, here it is. If you will put your trust in me you will not be mistaken. We can both give each other a great deal. Now, here is what I have decided: our compact will be in force until you grow up to be a real human being, a true Bolshevik. If I can't help you in that I am not worth a kopek. We must not break our compact until then. But when you grow up you will be freed of all obligations. Who knows what may happen? I may become a complete physical wreck, and in that case, remember, you must not consider yourself bound to me in any way." 

He fell silent for a few moments, then he went on in tender, caressing voice: "And for the present, I offer you my friendship and my love." 

He held her fingers in his, feeling at peace, as if she had already given her consent. 

"Do you promise never to leave me?" "I can only give you my word, Taya. It is for you to believe that men like me do not betray their friends. . . . I only hope they will not betray me," he added bitterly. "I can't give you an answer tonight. It is all very sudden," she replied. Pavel got up.

"Go to bed, Taya. It will soon be morning." He went to his own room and lay down on the bed without undressing and was asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. 

The desk by the window in Pavel's room was piled high with books from the Party library, newspapers and several notebooks filled with notes. A bed, two chairs and a huge map of China dotted with tiny black and red flags pinned up over the door between his room and Taya's, completed the furnishings. The people in the local Party Committee had agreed to supply Pavel with books and periodicals and had promised to instruct the manager of the biggest public library in town to send him whatever he needed. Before long large parcels of books began to arrive. Lola was amazed at the way he would sit over his books from early morning, reading and making notes all day long with only short breaks for breakfast and dinner. In the evenings, which he always spent with the two sisters, he would relate to them what he had read. 

Long past midnight old Kyutsam would see a chink of light between the shutters of the room occupied by his unwelcome lodger. He would creep over to the window on tiptoe and peer in through the crack at the head bent over the books. 

"Decent folks are in their beds at this hour but he keeps the light burning all night long. He behaves as if he were the master here. The girls have got altogether out of hand since he came," the old man would grumble to himself as he retired to his own quarters. 

For the first time in eight years Pavel found himself with plenty of time on his hands, and no duties of any kind to attend to. He made good use of his time, reading with the avid eagerness of the newly-enlightened. He studied eighteen hours a day. How much longer his health could have withstood the strain is hard to say, but a seemingly casual remark from Taya one day changed everything. 

"I have moved the chest of drawers away from the door leading to your room. If ever you want to talk to me you can come straight in. You don't need to go through Lola's room." The blood rushed to Pavel's cheeks. Taya smiled happily. Their compact was sealed.

The old man no longer saw the chink of light through the shuttered window of the corner room, and Taya's mother began to notice a glow in her daughter's eyes that betrayed a happiness she could not conceal. The faint shadows under her eyes spoke of sleepless nights. Often now Taya's singing and the strumming of a guitar echoed through the little house. 

Yet Taya's happiness was not unmarred; her awakened womanhood rebelled against the clandestine relationship. She trembled at every sound, fancying that she heard her mother's footsteps. What if they asked her why she had taken to closing her door on the latch at night? The thought tormented her. Pavel noticed her fears and tried to comfort her. 

"What are you afraid of?" he would say tenderly. "After all, you and I are grown-up people. Sleep in peace. No one shall intrude on our lives." 

Comforted, she would press her cheek against his breast, and fall asleep, her arms around her loved one. And he would lie awake, listening to her steady breathing, keeping quite still lest he disturb her slumber, his whole being flooded with a deep tenderness for this girl who had entrusted her life to him. 

Lola was the first to discover the reason for the shining light in Taya's eyes, and from that day the shadow of estrangement fell between the two sisters. Soon the mother too found out, or rather, guessed. And she was troubled. She had not expected it of Korchagin.

"Taya is not the wife for him," she remarked to Lola. "What will come of it, I wonder?"

Alarming thoughts beset her but she could not muster the courage to speak to Korchagin.

Young people began visiting Pavel, and sometimes his little room could barely hold them all. Thesound of their voices like the beehive's hum reached the old man's ears and often he could hear them singing in chorus:

Forbidding is this sea of ours,

Night and day its angry voice is heard. . .

and Pavel's favourite:

The whole wide world is drenched with tears....

It was the study circle of young workers which the Party Committee had assigned to Pavel in response to his insistent request for propaganda work.

Once more he had gripped the helm firmly with both hands, and the ship of life, having veered dangerously a few times, was now steering a new course. His dream of returning to the ranks through study and learning was on the way to being realised.

But life continued to heap obstacles in his path, and bitterly he saw each obstacle as a further delay to the attainment of his goal.

One day the ill-starred student George turned up from Moscow, bringing a wife with him. He put up at the house of his father-in-law, a lawyer, and from there continued

to pester his mother with demands for money.

George's coming widened the rift in the Kyutsam family. George at once sided with his father, and together with his wife's family, which was inclined to be anti-Soviet, he sought by underhand means to drive Korchagin out of the house and induce Taya to break with him.

Two weeks after George's arrival Lola got a job in another town and she left, taking her mother and her little son with her. Soon afterward, Pavel and Taya moved to a distant seaside town.

Artem did not often receive letters from his brother and the sight of an envelope with the familiar handwriting waiting for him on his desk in the City Soviet always made his heart beat faster.

Today too as he opened the envelope he thought tenderly:

"Ah, Pavel! If only you lived nearer to me. I could do with your advice, lad."

"Artem," he read. "I am writing to tell you all that has happened to me lately. I do not write such things to anyone but you. But I know I can confide in you because you know me well and you will understand.

"Life continues to press down on me on the health front, dealing me blow upon blow. I hardly managed to struggle to my feet after one blow when another, more merciless than the last, lays me low. The most terrible thing is that I am powerless to resist. First I lost the power of my left arm.

And now, as if that were not enough, my legs have failed me. I could barely move about (within the limits of the room, of course) as it was, but now I have difficulty in crawling from bed to table. 

And I daresay there is worse to come. What tomorrow will bring me no one knows. 

"I never leave the house now, and only a tiny fragment of the sea is visible from my window. Can there be a greater tragedy than that of a man who combines in himself a treacherous body that refuses to obey him, and the heart of a Bolshevik, a Bolshevik who passionately yearns to work, to be with all of you in the ranks of the fighters advancing along the whole front in the midst of the stormy avalanche? 

"I still believe that I shall return to the ranks, that in time my bayonet will take its place in the attacking columns. I must believe that, I have no right not to.

For ten years the Party and the Komsomol taught me to fight, and the leader's words, spoken to all of us, apply equally to me: 

'There are no fortresses Bolsheviks cannot take.' 

"My life now is spent entirely in study. Books, books and more books. I have accomplished a great deal, Artem. I have read and studied all the classics, and have passed my examinations in the first year of the correspondence course at the Communist University. In the evenings I lead a study circle of Communist youth. These young comrades are my link with the practical life of the Party organisation. Then there is Taya's education, and of course love, and the tender caresses of my little wife. Taya and I are the best of friends. Our household is very simply run — with my pension of thirty-two rubles and Taya's earnings we get along quite well. Taya is following the path I myself took to the Party: for a time she worked as a domestic servant, and now has a job as a dishwasher in a canteen (there is no industry in this town). 

"The other day she proudly showed me her first delegate's credentials issued by the Women's Department. This is not simply a strip of cardboard to her. In her I see the birth of the new woman, and I am doing my best to help in this birth. The time will come when she will work in a big factory, where as part of a large working community she will become politically mature. But she is taking the only possible course open to her here. 

"Taya's mother has visited us twice. Unconsciously she is trying to drag Taya back to a life of petty, personal selfish cares. I tried to make Albina see that she ought not to allow the shadow of her own unhappy past to darken the path her daughter has chosen. But it was no use. I feel that one day the mother will try to stand in her daughter's way and then a clash will be unavoidable. I shake your hand.

"Your Pavel."

Sanatorium No. 5 in Old Matsesta.... A three-storey brick building standing on a ledge hewed into the mountain-side. Thick woods all around and a road winding down to the sea. The windows are open and the breeze carries the smell of the sulphur springs into the room. Pavel Korchagin is alone in the room. Tomorrow new patients will arrive and then he will have a room-mate. He hears steps outside the window and the sound of a familiar voice. Several people are talking. But where has he heard that deep bass voice before? From the dim recesses of his memory, hidden away but not forgotten, comes the name: "Ledenev. He and none other." 

Pavel confidently called to his friend, and a moment later Ledenev was beside his bed shaking his hand warmly. 

"So Korchagin is still going strong? Well, and what have you got to say for yourself? Don't tell me you have decided to get sick in real earnest? That will never do!

You should take an example from me. The doctors have tried to put me on the shelf too, but I keep going just to spite them." And Ledenev laughed merrily. 

But Pavel felt the sympathy and distress hidden behind that laughter. 

They spent two hours together. Ledenev told Pavel all the latest news from Moscow. From him Pavel first heard of the important decisions taken by the Party on the

collectivisation of agriculture and the reorganisation of life in the village and he eagerly drank in every word. 

"Here I was thinking you were busy stirring things up somewhere at home in the Ukraine," said Ledenev. "You disappoint me. But never mind, I was in an even worse way. I thought I'd be tied to my bed for good, and now you see I'm still on my feet. There's no taking life easy nowadays. It simply won't work! I must confess I find myself thinking sometimes how nice it would be to take a little rest, just to catch your breath. After all, I'm not as young as I was, and ten and twelve hours' work a day is a bit hard on me at times. Well, I think about it for a while and even try to ease the load a little, but it's no use. Before you know it, you're up to your ears again, never getting home before midnight. The more powerful the machine, the faster the wheels run, and with us the speed increases every day, so that we old folk simply have to stay young." 

Ledenev passed a hand over his high forehead and said in a kindly manner: 

"And now tell me about yourself." 

Pavel gave Ledenev an account of his life since they had last met, and as he talked he felt his friend's warm approving glance on him.

Under the shade of spreading trees in one corner of the terrace a group of sanatorium patients were seated around a small table. One of them was reading the Pravda, his

bushy eyebrows knitted. The black Russian shirt, the shabby old cap and the unshaved face with deep-sunken blue eyes all bespoke the veteran miner. It was twelve years since Khrisanf Chernokozov had left the mines to take up an important post in the government, yet he seemed to have just come up from the pit. 

Everything about him, his bearing, his gait, his manner of speaking, betrayed his profession. 

Chernokozov was a member of the Territorial Party Bureau besides. A painful disease was sapping his strength: Chernokozov hated his gangrenous leg which had kept him tied to his bed for nearly half a year now. 

Opposite him, puffing thoughtfully on her cigarette, was Zhigareva — Alexandra Alexeyevna Zhigareva, who had been a Party member for nineteen of her thirty-seven years. "Shurochka the metalworker", as her comrades in the Petersburg underground movement used to call her, had been hardly more than a girl when she was exiled to Siberia. 

The third member of the group was Pankov. His handsome head with the sculptured profile was bent over a German magazine, and now and then he raised his hand to adjust his enormous horn-rimmed spectacles. It was painful to see this thirty-year-old man of athletic build dragging his paralysed leg after him. An editor and writer, Pankov worked in the People's Commissariat of Education. He was an authority on Europe and knew several foreign languages. He was a man of considerable erudition and even the reserved Chernokozov treated him with great respect. 

"So that is your room-mate?" Zhigareva whispered to Chernokozov, nodding toward the chair in which Pavel Korchagin was seated.

Chernokozov looked up from his newspaper and his brow cleared at once.

"Yes! That's Korchagin. You ought to know him, Shura. It's too bad illness has put many a spoke in his wheel, otherwise that lad would be a great help to us in tight spots. He belongs to the first Komsomol generation. I am convinced that if we give him our support — and that's what I have decided to do — he will still be able to work."

Pankov too listened to what Chernokozov was saying.

"What is he suffering from?" Shura Zhigareva asked softly.

"The aftermath of the Civil War. Some trouble with his spine. I spoke to the doctor here and he told me there is a danger of total paralysis. Poor lad!"

"I shall go and bring him over here," said Shura.

That was the beginning of their friendship. Pavel did not know then that Zhigareva and Chernokozov were to become very dear to him and that in the years of illness ahead of him they were to be his mainstays.

Life flowed on as before. Taya worked and Pavel studied. Before he had time to resume his work with the study groups another disaster stole upon him unawares. Both his legs were completely paralysed. Now only his right hand obeyed him. He bit his lips until the blood came when after repeated efforts he finally realised that he could not move. Taya bravely hid her despair and bitterness at being powerless to help him. But he said to her with an apologetic smile:

"You and I must separate, Taya. After all, this was not in our compact. I shall think it over properly today, little girl!"

She would not let him speak. The sobs burst forth and she hid her face against his chest in a paroxysm of weeping.

When Artem learned of his brother's latest misfortune he wrote to his mother. Maria Yakovlevna left everything and went at once to her son. Now the three lived together. Taya and the old lady took to each other from the first.

Pavel carried on with his studies in spite of everything.

One winter's evening Taya came home to report her first victory — she had been elected to the City Soviet. After that Pavel saw very little of her. When her day's work in the sanatorium kitchen was over Taya would go straight to the Soviet, returning home late at night weary but full of impressions. She was about to apply for candidate membership in the Party and was preparing for the long-awaited day with eager anticipation. And then misfortune struck another blow. The steadily progressing disease was doing its work. A burning excruciating pain suddenly seared Pavel's right eye, spreading rapidly to the left. A black curtain fell, blotting out all about him, and for the first time in his life Pavel knew the horror of total blindness.

A new obstacle had moved noiselessly onto his path barring his way. A terrifying, seemingly insurmountable obstacle. It plunged Taya and his mother into despair. But he, frigidly calm,resolved:

"I must wait and see what happens. If there is really no possibility of advancing, if everything I have done to return to the ranks has been swept away by this blindness I must put an end to it all."

Pavel wrote to his friends and they wrote back urging him to take courage and carry on the fight.

It was in these days of grim struggle for him that Taya came home radiant and announced:

"I am a candidate to the Party, Pavel!" 

Pavel listened to her excited account of the meeting at which her application was accepted and remembered his own initial steps in the Party. 

"Well, Comrade Korchagina, you and I are a Communist faction now," he said, squeezing her hand. 

The next day he wrote to the secretary of the District Party Committee asking the latter to come and see him. The same evening a mud-spattered car drew up outside the house and in a few moments Volmer, a middle-aged Lett with a spreading beard that reached to his ears, was pumping Pavel's hand. 

"Well, how goes it? What do you mean by behaving like this, eh? Up with you and we'll send you off to work in the village at once," he said with a breezy laugh. He stayed for two hours, forgetting all about the conference he was to have attended. He paced up and down the room, listening to Pavel's impassioned appeal for work. 

"Stop talking about study groups," he said when Pavel had finished. "You've got to rest. And we must see about your eyes. It may still be possible to do something. What about going to Moscow and consulting a specialist? You ought to think it over.. . ." But Pavel interrupted him: 

"I want people, Comrade Volmer, live, flesh-and-blood people! I need them now more than ever before. I cannot go on living alone. Send the youth to me, those with the least experience. They're veering too much to the left out there in the villages, the collective farms don't give them enough scope, they want to organise communes. You know the Komsomols, if you don't hold them back they're liable to try and dash forward ahead of the lines. I was like that myself." Volmer stopped in his tracks. 

"How do you come to know about that? They only brought the news in today from the district." 

Pavel smiled. 

"My wife told me. Perhaps you remember her? She was admitted to the Party yesterday." 

"Korchagina, the dishwasher? So that's your wife! I didn't know that!" He fell silent for a few moments, then he slapped his forehead as an idea occurred to him. "I know whom we'll send you. 

Lev Bersenev. You couldn't wish for a better comrade. He's a man after your own heart, the two of you ought to get along famously. Like two high-voltage transformers. I was an electrician once, you know. Lev will rig up a wireless for you, he's an expert at that sort of thing. I often sit up till two in the morning at his place with those earphones. The wife actually got suspicious. Wanted to know what I meant by coming home so late." Korchagin smiled. "Who is Bersenev?" he asked. 

Volmer ceased his pacing and sat down. "He's our notary public, although he's no more notary public really than I am a ballet dancer. He held an important post until quite recently. Been in the movement since 1912 and a Party member since the Revolution. Served in the Civil War on the revolutionary tribunal of the Second Cavalry Army; that was the time they were combing out the Whiteguard lice in the Caucasus. He was in Tsaritsyn too, and on the Southern Front as well. Then for a time he was a member of the Supreme Military Court of the Far Eastern Republic. Had a very tough time of it there. Finally tuberculosis got him. He left the Far East and came down here to the Caucasus. At first he worked as chairman of a gubernia court, and vice-chairman of a territorial court. And then his lung trouble knocked him out completely. It was a matter of coming down here and taking it easy or giving up the ghost. So that's how we come to have such a remarkable notary. It's a nice quiet job too, just the thing for him. Well, gradually the people here got him to take up a group. After that he was elected to the District Committee, then, before he knew it, he had charge of a political school, and now they've put him on the Control Commission. 

He's a permanent member on all important commissions appointed to unravel nasty tangles. Apart from all that he goes in for hunting, he's a passionate radio fan, and although he has only one lung, you wouldn't believe it to look at him. He is simply bursting with energy. When he dies it'll be somewhere on the way between the District Committee and the court." Pavel cut him short. 

"Why do you load him down like that?" he asked sharply. "He is doing more work here than before!" 

Volmer gave him a quizzical look: 

"And if I give you a study circle and something else Lev would be sure to say: 'Why must you load him down like that?' But he himself says he'd rather have one year of intensive work than five years on his back in hospital. It looks as if we'll have to build socialism before we can take proper care of our people." 

"That's true. I too prefer one year of life to five years of stagnation, but we are sometimes criminally wasteful of our energies. I know now that this is less a sign of heroism than of inefficiency and irresponsibility. Only now have I begun to see that I had no right to be so stupidly careless about my own health. I see now that there was nothing heroic about it at all. I might have held out a few more years if it hadn't been for that misguided Spartanism. In other words, the infantile disease of leftism is one of the chief dangers." 

"That's what he says now," thought Volmer, "but let him get back on his feet and he'll forget everything but work." But he said nothing. 

The following evening Lev Bersenev came. It was midnight before he left Pavel. He went away feeling as if he had found a brother. 

In the morning a wireless antenna was set up on the roof of Korchagin's house, while Lev busied himself inside the house with the receiving set, regaling Pavel the while with interesting stories from his past. Pavel could not see him, but from what Taya had told him he knew that Lev was a tall, fair-haired, blue-eyed young man with impulsive gestures, which was exactly as Pavel had pictured him the moment they had first met. 

When evening came three valves began to glow in the room. Lev triumphantly handed Pavel the earphones. A chaos of sounds filled the ether. The transmitters in the port chirped like so many birds, and somewhere not far out at sea a ship's wireless was sending out an endless stream of dots and dashes. But in this vortex of noises and sounds jostling one another the tuning coil picked out and clung to a calm and confident voice: 

"This is Moscow calling...." 

The tiny wireless set brought sixty broadcasting stations in different parts of the world within Pavel's reach. The life from which he had been debarred broke through to him from the earphone membranes, and once again he felt its mighty pulse. 

Noticing the glow of pleasure in Pavel's eyes, the weary Bersenev smiled with satisfaction.

The big house was hushed. Taya murmured restlessly in her sleep. Pavel saw little of his wife these days. She came home late, worn out and shivering from cold. Her work claimed more and more of her time and seldom did she have a free evening. Pavel remembered what Bersenev had told him on this score:

"If a Bolshevik has a wife who is his Party comrade they rarely see one another. But this has two advantages: they never get tired of each other, and there's no time to quarrel!" And indeed, how could he object? It was only to be expected. There was a time when Taya had devoted all her evenings to him. There had been more warmth and tenderness in their relationship then. But she had been only a wife, a mate to him; now she was his pupil and his Party comrade.

He knew that the more Taya matured politically, the less time she would be able to give him, and he bowed to the inevitable.

He was given a study group to lead and once again a noisy hum of voices filled the house in the evenings. These hours spent with the youth infused Pavel with new energy and vigour.

The rest of the time went in listening to the radio, and his mother had difficulty in tearing him away from the earphones at mealtimes.

The radio gave him what his blindness had taken from him — the opportunity to acquire knowledge, and this consuming passion for learning helped him to forget the pain that racked his body, the fire that seared his eyes and all the misery an unkind fate had heaped upon him.

When the radio brought the news from Magnitostroi of the exploits of the Komsomols who had succeeded Pavel's generation he was filled with happiness.

He pictured the cruel blizzards, the bitter Urals frosts as vicious as a pack of hungry wolves. He heard the howling of the wind and saw amid the whirling of the snow a detachment of second-generation Komsomols working in the light of arc lamps on the roof of the giant factory buildings to save the first sections of the huge plant from the ravages of snow and ice. Compared to this,how tiny seemed the forest construction job on which the first generation of Kiev Komsomols had battled with the elements!

The country had grown, and with it, the people.And on the Dnieper, the water had burst through the steel barriers and swept away men and machines. And again the Komsomol youth had hurled themselves into the breach, and after a furious two-day battle had brought the unruly torrent back under control. A new Komsomol generation marched in the van of this great struggle. And among the heroes Pavel heard with pride the name of his old comrade Ignat Pankratov.

　　海浪在他脚下拍打着岸边的乱石。从遥远的土耳其吹来的干燥的海风，吹拂着他的脸。这里的海岸曲折地弯进陆地，形成一个港湾，港口有一条钢骨水泥的防波堤。蜿蜒起伏的山峦伸到海边突然中断了。市郊的一座座小白房像玩具似的，顺着山势向上，伸展到很远的地方。

　　古老的郊区公园里静悄悄的。很久没有人收拾的小径长满了野草。被秋风吹落的枯黄的槭树叶，慢慢地飘向地面。

　　一个波斯老车夫把保尔从城里拉到这里。他扶着这位古怪的乘客下车的时候，忍不住问道：“你到这儿来干吗？没姑娘，也没戏院，只有胡狼……真不明白，你来干什么！还是坐我的车回去吧，同志先生！”

　　保尔付了车钱，老车夫也就走了。

　　公园里一个人也没有。保尔在海边找到一条长凳，坐了下来，让已经不太热的太阳照着他的脸。

　　今天，他特意到这僻静的地方来，回顾他的生活历程，考虑今后怎么办。该是进行总结，做出决定的时候了。

　　保尔第二次到丘察姆家，使这一家的矛盾激化到了极点。

　　老头子听说他来了，暴跳如雷，在家里大闹了一场。领着母女三人进行反抗的，当然是保尔了。老头子没有想到，妻子和女儿会给他这样有力的反击。从保尔来到那天起，这一家人就分开过了，两边的人互相敌对，彼此仇视。通向两个老人房间的过道钉死了，把一间小厢房租给了保尔。房钱是预先付给老头子的。他似乎很快也就坦然了：两个女儿既然同他分了家，就再也不会向他要生活费用了。

　　从外交上着想，阿莉比娜仍然跟老头子住在一起。老头子不愿意同那个冤家照面，从来不到年轻人这边来。但是在院子里，他却像火车头一样喘着粗气，表示他是这里的主人。

　　老头子没有到合作社工作以前，会两门手艺——掌鞋和做木工活。他把板棚改成了作坊，抽空捞点外快。现在，为了同房客捣乱，他故意把工作台搬到保尔的窗子底下，幸灾乐祸地使劲敲钉子。他非常清楚，这样一来保尔就看不成书了。

　　“等着瞧吧。我早晚要把你赶出去……”他低声嘟哝着。

　　在接近地平线的远方，远航轮船吐出来的黑烟，像乌云一样在渐渐扩散。一群海鸥尖叫着，向海上飞去。

　　保尔双手抱着头，陷入了沉思。他的一生，从童年到现在，一幕幕在他眼前闪过。这二十四年他过得怎样？好，还是不好？他一年又一年地回忆着，像一个铁面无私的法官，检查着自己的一生。结果他非常满意，这一生过得还不怎么坏。

　　当然也犯过不少错误，有时是因为糊涂，有时是因为年轻，多半则是由于无知。但是最主要的一点是，在火热的斗争年代，他没有睡大觉，在夺取政权的激烈搏斗中，他找到了自己的岗位，在革命的红旗上，也有他的几滴鲜血。

　　我们的旗帜在全世界飘扬，

　　它燃烧，放射出灿烂的光芒，

　　那是我们的热血，鲜红似火……

　　他小声诵读着他喜爱的一首歌曲中的诗句，难为情地笑了。“老弟，你那点英雄浪漫主义，还没有完全扔掉呢。平平常常、普普通通的东西，你总爱给它们抹上一层绚丽的色彩。

　　可要说到辩证唯物主义的钢铁逻辑，老弟，那你就差劲啦。着忙生什么病呢？过五十年生也不晚嘛。同志，现在应该学习，正是大好时机。而眼下要紧的是活下去，他妈的。我怎么那么早就给捆住了手脚呢？”他十分痛苦地想着，五年来第一次恶狠狠地骂开了娘。

　　难道他能料到这种飞来的横祸吗？老天爷给了他一副什么都经受得起的、结结实实的身板。他回想起小时候跟风比赛，飞快地奔跑，爬起树来跟猴子一样灵活，四肢有力、肌肉发达的身子轻而易举从这根树枝挪腾到那根树枝上。但是动乱的岁月要求人们付出超人的力量和意志。他没有吝惜，无保留地把全部精力奉献给了以不灭的火焰照亮他生活之路的斗争。他献出了他拥有的一切，到了二十四岁，风华正茂之时，正当胜利的浪潮把他推上创造性幸福生活的顶峰，他却被击中了。他没有马上倒下，而是像一个魁伟的战士，咬紧牙关，追随着胜利进击的无产阶级的钢铁大军。在耗尽全部精力以前，他没有离开过战斗的队伍。现在他身体垮了，再也不能在前线坚持战斗。唯一能做的事是进后方医院。他还记得，在进攻华沙的激战中，一个战士被子弹打中了，从马上跌下来，摔倒在地上。战友们给他匆忙地包扎好伤口，把他交给卫生员，又翻身上马，追赶敌人去了。骑兵队伍并没有因为失去一个战士而停止前进。为伟大的事业进行斗争的时候就是这样，也应该是这样。不错，也有例外。他就见到过失去双腿的机枪手，在机枪车上坚持战斗。这些战士对敌人来说是最可怕的人，他们的机枪给敌人送去死亡和毁灭。这些同志意志如钢，枪法准确，他们是团队的骄傲。不过，这样的战士毕竟不多。

　　现在，他身体彻底垮了，失去了重新归队的希望，他该怎样对待自己呢？他终于使巴扎诺娃吐露了真情，这个女医生告诉他，前面还有更可怕的不幸等待着他。怎么办？这个恼人的问题就摆在面前，逼着他解决。

　　他已经失去了最宝贵的东西——战斗的能力，活着还有什么用呢？在今天，在凄凉的明天，他用什么来证明自己生活得有价值呢？又有什么来充实自己的生活呢？光是吃、喝、呼吸吗？当一名力不从心的旁观者，看着战友们向前冲杀吗？

　　就这样成为战斗队伍的累赘吗？他想起了基辅无产阶级的领袖叶夫格妮亚·博什。这位久经考验的女地下工作者得了肺结核，丧失了工作能力，不久前自杀身亡。她在简短的留言中解释了这样做的理由：“我不能接受生活的施舍。既然成了自己的党的病患，我认为继续活下去是不必要的。”把背叛了自己的肉体也消灭掉，怎么样？朝心口开一枪，就完事了！过去既然能够生活得不坏，现在也应该能够适时地结束生命。一个战士不愿再受临终前痛苦的折磨，谁能去责备他呢？

　　他的手摸到了口袋里光滑的勃朗宁手枪，手指习惯地抓住了枪柄。他慢慢掏出手枪。

　　“谁想到你会有今天？”

　　枪口轻蔑地直视着他的眼睛。他把手枪放到膝上，恶狠狠地骂了起来：“这算什么英雄，纯粹是冒牌货，老弟！任何一个笨蛋，随便什么时候，都会对自己开一枪。这样摆脱困境，是最怯懦、最省事的办法。生活不下去——就一死了之。对懦夫来说，也不需要更好的出路。你试过去战胜这种生活吗？你尽一切努力冲破这铁环了吗？你忘了在诺沃格勒—沃伦斯基附近，是怎样一天发起十七次冲锋，终于排除万难，攻克了那座城市吗？把枪藏起来吧，永远也不要对任何人提起这件事。

　　就是到了生活已经无法忍受的时候，也要善于生活下去，要竭尽全力，使生命变得有益于人民。”

　　他站起来，朝大道走去。一个过路的山里人赶着四轮马车，顺路把他拉进城里。进城后，他在一个十字路口买了一份当地的报纸。报上登着本市党组织在杰米扬·别德内依俱乐部开会的通知。保尔回到住处的时候，已经是深夜了。他在积极分子会议上讲了话，自己也没有想到，这竟是他最后一次在大会上讲话。

　　达雅还没有睡。保尔出去这么久没有回来，她很担心。他怎么啦？到哪儿去了呢？她发觉保尔那双一向活泼的眼睛，今天显得严峻而冷漠。他很少讲到自己，但是达雅感觉到，他正在遭受某种不幸。

　　母亲房里的钟敲了两下，外面传来了叩门声。她立即披上外套，跑去开门。廖莉娅在自己房间里，喃喃地说着梦话。

　　“我都担心你出了什么事呢。”保尔走进过道的时候，达雅小声对他说。她很高兴他终于回来了。

　　“我是到死也不会出什么事的，达尤莎。怎么，廖莉娅睡了吗？你知道，我一点也不想睡。我要把今天的事跟你谈一谈。到你屋里去吧，要不，会把廖莉娅吵醒的。”他也小声对她说。

　　达雅犹豫了一下。她怎么好深更半夜还同他在一起谈话呢？母亲知道了，会怎么想呢？但是这话又不便对保尔讲，他会不高兴的。再说，他想告诉她什么呢？她一边想，一边已经走进自己的房间。

　　“是这么回事，达雅，”他们在黑暗的房间里面对面地坐下之后，保尔压低了声音说。他俩离得很近，达雅连他的呼吸都可以感觉到。“生活起了这样的变化，我自己也有点莫名其妙。这些日子我心情很不好。我不知道在这个世界上今后该怎么生活。有生以来，我从来没有像这几天这样苦闷。今天我召开了自己的‘政治局’会议，做出了非常重要的决议。

　　我把这些话告诉你，你可不要感到奇怪。”

　　保尔把近几个月的全部心情和今天在郊区公园里的许多想法都告诉了她。

　　“情况就是这样。现在谈谈主要的吧。你们家里的这场好戏刚刚开锣，你得冲出去，吸吸新鲜空气，离开这个窝越远越好。应该从新开始生活。我既然卷入了这场斗争，咱们就把它进行到底。你我两人的个人生活都不痛快。我决心放一把火，让它烧起来。你明白这是什么意思吗？你愿意做我的朋友，做我的妻子吗？”

　　达雅一直十分激动地听着他的倾诉，听到最后一句话，她感到很意外，不由得打了一个寒战。保尔接着说：“达雅，我并不要求你今天就答复我。你好好地全面想一想。你一定不明白，这个人怎么不献一点殷勤，不说一句甜言蜜语，就提出这种问题。要那套无聊的玩意儿干什么呢！我把手伸给你，就在这儿，小姑娘，握住它吧。要是这次你相信我，你是不会受骗的。我有许多东西是你需要的，反过来也是一样。我已经想好了：咱们的结合一直延续到你成长为一个真正的人，成为我们的同志，我一定能帮助你做到这一点，不然，我就一点价值也没有了。在这之前，咱们都不能破坏这个结合。一旦你成熟了，你可以不受任何义务的约束。

　　谁知道，也许有一天我会完全瘫痪。你记住，到那时候我也绝不拖累你。”

　　稍停片刻，他又亲切而温情地说：“现在我就请你接受我的友谊和爱情。”

　　他握住她的手不放，心情很平静，好像她已经答应了他似的。

　　“你不会抛弃我吗？”

　　“达雅，口说不足为凭。你相信一点好了：像我这样的人是不会背叛朋友的……但愿朋友们也不背叛我。”他辛酸地结束了他的话。

　　“我今天什么都不能对你说，这一切来得太突然了。”她回答说。

　　保尔站了起来。

　　“睡吧，达雅，天快亮了。”

　　他回到自己房间，和衣躺在床上，头刚挨着枕头，就睡着了。

　　保尔房间里，靠窗有一张桌子，上面放着几摞从党委图书馆借来的书，一沓报纸和几本写得满满的笔记。还有一张从房东那里借来的床，两把椅子；有一扇门通达雅的房间，门上挂着一幅很大的中国地图，上面插着许多红色和黑色的小旗。保尔取得了当地党委的同意，可以利用党委资料室的书刊，党委还指定本城最大的港口图书馆主任当他的读书指导。

　　不久他就陆续借来了大批书籍。廖莉娅看着他，觉得很惊奇，他从清早到晚上一直埋头读书，做笔记，只在吃饭的时候才休息一会儿。每天晚上，他们三个人都在廖莉娅房间里谈天，保尔把读到的东西讲给姐妹俩听。

　　老头子后半夜到院子里，总是看到那个不受欢迎的房客的窗户里透出一线灯光。老头子踮起脚，悄悄走到窗前，从窗板缝里看到了伏在桌子上读书的保尔的头。

　　“别人都睡了，可这位呢，点着灯整宿不睡。大模大样，像是他当家一样。两个丫头也敢跟我顶嘴了。”老头子闷闷不乐地想着，走开了。

　　八年来，保尔第一次不担任任何工作，有这么多的空闲时间。他像一个刚刚入门的学生，如饥似渴地读着书，每天读十八个小时。长此以往，他的健康会受到多大的危害，就难说了。幸好有一天，达雅像是随便告诉他：“我把柜子搬开了，通你房间的门已经可以打开。你有什么事要找我谈，可以走这个门，不用再穿过廖莉娅的房间了。”

　　保尔的脸上露出了光彩。达雅高兴地浅浅一笑——他们的结合成功了。

　　从此，老头子半夜里再也看不到厢房的窗户透出灯光，母亲开始发现达雅眼神里有掩饰不住的欢乐。她的两只眼睛被内心的火烧得亮晶晶的，眼睛下面隐约现出两块暗影——这是不眠之夜的结果。这座不大的住宅里，经常可以听到吉他的琴声和达雅的歌声了。

　　这个获得了欢乐的女人也常常感到苦恼，她觉得自己的爱情好像是偷来的。有一点响动，她就要哆嗦一下，总觉得是母亲的脚步声。她老是担心，万一有人问她为什么每天晚上要把房门扣上，她该怎么回答呢。保尔看出了她的心情，温柔地安慰她说：“你怕什么呢？仔细分析起来，你我就是这里的主人。放心睡吧。谁也没有权力干涉咱们的生活。”

　　达雅脸贴着爱人的胸脯，搂着他，安心地睡着了。保尔久久地听着她的呼吸，一动也不动，生怕惊醒她的甜梦。他对这个把一生托付给他的少女，充满了深切的柔情。

　　达雅的眼睛近来总是那样明亮，第一个知道这个原因的，是廖莉娅，从此，姐妹俩就疏远了。不久，母亲也知道了，确切些说，是猜到了。她警觉起来，没有想到保尔会这样。有一次，她对廖莉娅说：“达尤莎配不上他。这么下去会有什么结果呢？”

　　她忧心忡忡，却又没有勇气同保尔谈谈。

　　青年们开始来找保尔。小房间有时挤得满满的。蜂群一样的嗡嗡声不时传到老头子耳朵里。他们常常齐声歌唱：

　　我们的大海一片荒凉，

　　日日夜夜不停地喧嚷……

　　有时候唱保尔喜爱的歌：

　　泪水洒遍茫茫大地……

　　这是工人党员积极分子小组在集会，保尔写信要求担负一点宣传工作，党委就把这个小组交给了他。保尔的日子就是这样度过的。

　　保尔双手重新把住了舵轮，生活的巨轮几经周折，又朝着新的目的地驶去。他的目标是通过学习，通过文学，重返战斗行列。

　　但是，生活给他设置了一个又一个障碍，每次遇到波折，他都不安地想：这回对他达到目的地，不知道会有多大影响。

　　突然，那个考大学不走运的乔治带着老婆从莫斯科回来了。他住在革命前当过律师的岳父家里，不断回来刮他母亲的钱。

　　乔治一回来，家庭关系更加恶化了。他毫不犹豫地站在父亲一边，并且同那个敌视苏维埃政权的岳父一家串通一气，施展阴谋诡计，一心要把保尔从家里轰出去，把达雅夺回来。

　　乔治回来以后两个星期，廖莉娅在邻区找到了工作，带着母亲和儿子搬走了。保尔和达雅也搬到很远的一个滨海小城去了。

　　半年过去了。国家开始进行伟大的工程。社会主义已经到了现实生活的门槛前面，正由理想变成人类智慧和双手创造的庞然巨物。这座空前宏伟壮观的大厦正在奠定它的钢筋混凝土的地基。

　　“钢、铁、煤”这三个有魔力的词越来越多地出现在进行伟大建设的国家的报纸上。

　　“要么我们跑完这段距离，赶上技术发达的资本主义国家，用最短的时间，也建立起自己强大的工业，使我们在技术方面不依赖于资本主义世界，要么我们就被踩死，因为没有钢、铁、煤，不要说建成社会主义，就是保住正在进行社会主义建设的国家，也是办不到的。”党通过领袖之口这样告诉全国人民，于是全国出现了为钢铁而战的空前热潮，人们迸发出来的巨大激情世所未见。“速度”这个词也发出了热烈的行动号召。

　　在久远的古代，为抵抗贵族波兰以及当时还强盛的土耳其的入侵，哥萨克分队曾驰骋在扎波罗什营地上，杀得敌人闻风丧胆，如今在昔日的营地上，在霍尔季扎岛近旁，另有一支部队在安营扎寨。这是布尔什维克的部队，他们决定拦腰截断古老的第聂伯河，驾驭它那狂暴的原始力量，去开动钢铁的涡轮机，让这条古老的河流像生活本身一样为社会主义工作。人向自然界发动了进攻，在汹涌的第聂伯河的急流处，给它桀骜不驯的力量戴上钢筋水泥的枷锁。

　　在三万名向第聂伯河开战的大军中，在这支大军的指挥员中，有过去的基辅码头工人、现今的建筑工段段长伊格纳特·潘克拉托夫。大军从两岸向河流夹击，从战斗打响的第一天起，两岸之间就展开了社会主义竞赛，这是工人生活中的新生事物。

　　潘克拉托夫那硕大的身躯轻快地在跳板上、小桥上跑来跑去，一会儿在搅拌机旁跟弟兄们说两句俏皮话，一会儿消失在土壕沟里，一会儿又突然在卸水泥和钢梁的站台上露面。

　　一大清早，他那佝偻的身子出现在“吃紧的”工区，直到深夜他才把终于疲乏了的巨大躯体放倒在行军床上。

　　有一次，他面对晨雾笼罩的河面，面对河岸上一望无际的建筑材料，看得出了神，不禁回想起森林中小小的博亚尔卡。当时似乎是一个大工程，同目前的情景相比，不过是一件儿童玩具罢了。

　　“瞧咱们这气派，发展得多快，伊格纳特好兄弟。第聂伯河这匹烈马让咱们给套住了。老爷子们再也不用在这急流险滩上折腾吃苦头啦。给你一百万度电，没说的！这才是咱们真正生活的开端，伊格纳特。”一股热流从他胸中涌起，仿佛他贪婪地喝下了一杯烈酒似的。“博亚尔卡那些弟兄们在哪儿呢？把保尔，还有扎尔基两口子都叫来多好，咳！那我们就把左岸的人给盖啦。”想到博亚尔卡，他又不由得想起了朋友们。

　　那些跟他一起在隆冬季节大战博亚尔卡的人，还有那些共同创建共青团组织的人，如今分散在全国各地，从热火朝天的新建筑工地到辽阔无边的祖国的偏僻角落，都在重建新生活。过去，他们那批早期共青团员，大约有一万五千人。有时在茫茫人海中相遇，真是亲如手足。现在，他们那个小小的共青团已成为巨人。原先只有一个团员的地方，如今能拉出整整一个营。

　　“冲我们来吧，小鬼头们。前不久还在桌子底下钻来钻去呢。我们已经在前线干开了，他们还要妈妈用衣襟替他们擦鼻涕。一转眼的工夫，都蹿起来了，在工地上还拼命想把你撵到乌龟壳里去。对不起，这一招可不行。咱们还得走着瞧。”

　　潘克拉托夫饱吸了一口河边清新的空气，深深感受到一种满足。二十岁的共青团员安德留沙·小托卡列夫在左岸第七工段当支部书记，今天晚上潘克拉托夫要把那个工段“挂到自己拖轮的钩子上”，到那时他肯定也会有这种满足感的。

　　至于刚才他回忆起的那位朋友和战友保夫鲁沙·柯察金，他现在被抛弃在偏僻遥远的滨海小城，为争取归队而进行着顽强艰苦的斗争，既有失败的悲哀，也有胜利的欢乐。

　　阿尔焦姆很少收到弟弟的信。每当他在市苏维埃办公桌上见到灰色信封和那有棱有角的熟悉的字体，他就会失去往常的平静。现在，他一面撕开信封，一面深情地想：“唉，保夫鲁沙，保夫鲁沙！咱们要是住在一起该多好。

　　你经常给我出出主意，对我一定很有用，弟弟！”

　　保尔信上说：

　　阿尔焦姆：

　　我想跟你谈谈我的情况。除你以外，我大概是不会给任何人写这样的信的。你了解我，能理解我的每一句话。我在争取恢复健康的战场上，继续遭到生活的排挤。

　　我受到接连不断的打击。一次打击过后，我刚刚站起来，另一次打击又接踵而来，比上一次更厉害。最可怕的是我现在没有力量反抗了。左臂已经不听使唤。这就够痛苦的了，可是接着两条腿也不能活动了。我本来只能在房间里勉强走动，现在从床边挪到桌子跟前也要费很大劲。到这步田地大概还不算完。明天会怎么样——还很难说。

　　我已经出不去屋，只能从窗口看到大海的一角。一个人有一颗布尔什维克的心，有布尔什维克的意志，他是那样迫不及待地向往劳动，向往加入你们全线进攻的大军，向往投身到滚滚向前、排山倒海的钢铁巨流中去，可是他的躯体却背叛了他，不听他的调遣。这两者集中在一个人身上，还有比这更可怕的悲剧吗？

　　不过我还是相信我能够重返战斗行列，相信在冲锋陷阵的大军中也会有我的一把刺刀。我不能不相信，我没有权利不相信。十年来，党和共青团教给了我反抗的艺术。领袖说过，没有布尔什维克攻不克的堡垒，这句话对我也适用。

　　阿尔焦姆，你会说我信里有许多熔化了的钢铁。本来嘛，我们的生活本身也不是靠蛤蟆的冷冰冰的血点燃起来的。我要你和我一道相信，保尔会回到你们身边的，哥哥，咱们还要一起好好干呢。不可能不是这样，要不然，当罪恶的旧世界已经在我们的马蹄下声嘶力竭地呻吟的时候，国内战争的火红战旗怎么还会使我们热血沸腾呢？如果在棘手的，有时甚至是残忍的生活面前我们屈膝下跪，承认失败，那我们工人的坚强意志还从何说起呢？

　　阿尔焦姆，朋友们听到这些话时，我有时也看到有人流露出惊奇的目光。谁知道，也许有人会想：他是让理想遮住了眼睛，看不到现实。他们不明白我的希望寄托在什么地方。

　　现在稍稍讲讲其他方面的情况。我的生活已形成了一个格局，局限在一块小小的军事基地上。这就是我的学习——读书，读书，还是读书。阿尔焦姆，我已经读了很多书，收获颇丰。国外的、国内的著作我都读。读完了主要的古典文学作品，学完了共产主义函授大学一年级课程，考试也及格了。晚上我辅导一个青年党员小组学习。通过这些同志，我和党组织的实际工作保持着联系。此外，还有达尤莎，她的成长和她的进步，当然还有她的爱情，她那妻子的温存体贴。

　　我们俩生活得很和美。我们的经济情况是一目了然的——我的三十二个卢布抚恤金和达雅的工资。她正沿着我走过的道路走到党的行列里来：她以前给人家当佣人，现在是食堂里的洗碗女工（这个小城没有工厂）。

　　前几天，达雅拿回来第一次当选为妇女部代表的证件，兴高采烈地给我看。对她来说，这不是一张普通的硬纸片。我注意地观察着她，看到一个新人在逐步成长，我尽自己的全部力量帮助她。总有一天，她会进入一个大工厂，生活在工人集体中间，到那时候，她就会最后成熟了。目前在我们这个小城里，她还只能走这条唯一可行的道路。

　　达雅的母亲来过两次。她不自觉地在拉女儿的后腿，要把她拉回到充满卑微琐事的生活中去，让她再陷入狭隘、孤独的生活圈子里。我努力劝说老太太，告诉她不应该让她过去的生活在女儿前进的道路上投下阴影。但是，这一切努力都白费。我觉得，达雅的母亲有一天会成为她走向新生活的障碍，跟这个老太太的斗争是不可避免的。

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　握手。

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　你的保尔

　　老马采斯塔的第五疗养院是一座石砌的三层楼房，修建在悬崖上开辟出来的平场上。四周林木环抱，一条道路曲折地通到山脚下。所有房间的窗户全敞开着，微风吹拂，送来了山下矿泉的硫磺气味。保尔房间里只有他一个人。明天要来一批新疗养员，那时他就有同伴了。窗外传来一阵脚步声。

　　有好几个人在谈话。其中一个人的声音很耳熟，他在什么地方听到过这浑厚的男低音呢？他苦苦思索，终于把藏在记忆深处的一个还没有忘却的名字找了出来：英诺肯季·帕夫洛维奇·列杰尼奥夫，正是他，不会是别人。保尔蛮有把握地喊了他一声。过了一分钟，列杰尼奥夫已经坐在他的旁边，快活地拉住他的手了。

　　“你还活着哪？怎么样，有什么好事让我高兴高兴？你这是怎么啦，真正当起病号来了？这我可不赞成。你得向我学习。大夫也早说过我非退休不可，我就不听他们那一套，一直坚持到现在。”列杰尼奥夫温厚地笑了起来。

　　保尔体会到他的笑谈中隐藏着同情，又流露出一丝忧虑。

　　他们畅谈了两个小时。列杰尼奥夫讲了莫斯科的新闻。从他嘴里，保尔第一次听

Part Two Chapter 9
---

They spent the first few days in Moscow with a friend who was arranging for Pavel to enter a special clinic.

Only now did Pavel realise how much easier it had been to be brave when he had his youth and a strong body. Now that life held him in its iron grip to hold out was a matter of honour.

It was a year and a half since Pavel Korchagin had come to Moscow. Eighteen months of indescribable anguish.

In the eye clinic Professor Averbach had told Pavel quite frankly that there was no hope of recovering his sight. Some time in the future, when the inflammation disappeared it might be possible to operate on the pupils. In the meantime he advised an operation to halt the inflammatory process.

Pavel gave his consent; he told his doctors to do everything they thought necessary.

Three times he felt the touch of Death's bony fingers as he lay for hours at a time on the operating table with lancets probing his throat to remove the parathyroid gland. But he clung tenaciously to life and, after long hours of anguished suspense, Taya would find him deathly pale but alive and as calm and gentle as always.

"Don't worry, little girl, it's not so easy to kill me. I'll go on living and kicking up a fuss if only to upset the calculations of the learned doctors. They are right in everything they say about my health, but they are gravely mistaken when they try to write me off as totally unfit for work. I'll show them yet."

Pavel was determined to resume his place in the ranks of the builders of the new life. He knew now what he had to do.

Winter was over, spring had burst through the open windows, and Pavel, having survived another operation, resolved that, weak as he was, he would remain in hospital no longer. To live so many months in the midst of human suffering, to have to listen to the groans of the incurably sick was far harder for him than to endure his own anguish.

And so when another operation was proposed, he refused.

"No," he said firmly. "I've had enough. I have shed enough blood for science. I have other uses for what is left."

That day Pavel wrote a letter to the Central Committee, explaining that since it was now useless for him to continue his wanderings in search of medical treatment, he wished to remain in Moscow where his wife was now working. It was the first time he had turned to the Party for help.

His request was granted and the Moscow Soviet gave him living quarters. Pavel left the hospital with the fervent hope that he might never return.

The modest room in a quiet side lane off Kropotkinskaya Street seemed to him the height of luxury. And often, waking at night, Pavel would find it hard to believe that hospital was indeed a thing of the past for him now.

Taya was a full-fledged Party member by now. She was an excellent worker, and in spite of the tragedy of her personal life, she did not lag behind the best shock workers at the factory. Her fellow workers soon showed their respect for this quiet, unassuming young woman by electing her a member of the factory trade-union committee. Pride for his wife, who was proving to be a true Bolshevik, made Pavel's sufferings easier to bear.

Bazhanova came to Moscow on business and paid him a visit. They had a long talk. Pavel grew animated as he told her of his plans to return in the near future to the fighting ranks.

Bazhanova noticed the wisp of silver on Pavel's temples and she said softly:

"I see that you have gone through a great deal. Yet you have lost none of your enthusiasm. Andthat is the main thing. I am glad that you have decided to begin the work for which you have beenpreparing these past five years. But how do you intend to go about it?"

Pavel smiled confidently. 

"Tomorrow my friends are bringing me a sort of cardboard stencil, which will enable me to write without getting the lines mixed up. I couldn't write without it. I hit upon the idea after much thought. You see, the stiff edges of the cardboard will keep my pencil from straying off the straight line. Of course, it is very hard to write without seeing what you are writing, but it is not impossible. I have tried it and I know. It took me some time to get the knack of it, but now I have learned to write more slowly, taking pains with every letter and the result is quite satisfactory." 

And so Pavel began to work. 

He had conceived the idea of writing a novel about the heroic Kotovsky Division. The title came of itself: Born of the Storm. 

His whole life was now geared to the writing of his book. Slowly, line by line, the pages emerged. 

He worked oblivious to his surroundings, wholly immersed in the world of images, and for the first time he suffered the throes of creation, knew the bitterness the artist feels when vivid, unforgettable scenes so tangibly perceptible turn pallid and lifeless on paper. 

He had to remember everything he wrote, word by word. The slightest interruption caused him to lose the thread of his thoughts and retarded his work. 

Sometimes he had to recite aloud whole pages and even chapters from memory, and there were moments when his mother feared that he was losing his mind. She did not dare approach him while he worked, but as she picked up the sheets that had fallen on the floor she would say timidly: 

"I do wish you would do something else, Pavlusha. It can't be good for you to keep writing all the time like this. ..." 

He would laugh heartily at her fears and assure the old lady that she need not worry, he hadn't "gone crazy yet". 

Three chapters of the book were finished. Pavel sent them to Odessa to his old fighting comrades from the Kotovsky Division for their opinion, and before long he received a letter praising his work. But on its way back to him the manuscript was lost in the mails. Six months' work was gone. It was a terrible blow to him. Bitterly he regretted having sent off the only copy he possessed. Ledenev scolded him roundly when he heard what had happened. 

"How could you have been so careless? But never mind, it's no use crying over spilt milk. You must begin over again." 

"But I have been robbed of six months' work. Eight hours of strenuous labour every day. Curse the parasites!" 

Ledenev did his best to console his friend. 

There was nothing for it but to start afresh. Ledenev supplied him with paper and helped him to get the manuscript typed. Six weeks later the first chapter was rewritten. A family by the name of Alexeyev lived in the same apartment as the Korchagins. The eldest son, Alexander, was secretary of one of the district committees of the Komsomol. His sister Galya, a lively girl of eighteen, had finished a factory training school. Pavel asked his mother to speak to Galya and find out whether she would agree to help him with his work in the capacity of "secretary". Galya willingly agreed. She came in one day, smiling pleasantly, and was delighted when she learned that Pavel was writing a novel. 

"I shall be very glad to help you, Comrade Korchagin," she said. "It will be so much more fun than writing those dull circular letters for father about the maintenance of hygiene in communal apartments."

From that day Pavel's work progressed with doubled speed. Indeed so much was accomplished in one month that Pavel was amazed. Galya's lively participation and sympathy were a great help to him. Her pencil rustled swiftly over the paper, and whenever some passage particularly appealed to her she would read it over several times, taking sincere delight in Pavel's success. She was almost the only person in the house who believed in his work, the others felt that nothing would come of it and that Pavel was merely trying to fill in the hours of enforced idleness.Ledenev, returning to Moscow after a business trip out of town, read the first few chapters and said:

"Carry on, my friend. I have no doubt that you will win. You have great happiness in store for you, Pavel. I firmly believe that your dream of returning to the ranks will soon materialise. Don't lose hope, my son."

The old man went away deeply satisfied to have found Pavel so full of energy.

Galya came regularly, her pencil raced over the pages reviving scenes from the unforgettable past.

In moments when Pavel lay lost in thought, overwhelmed by a flood of memory, Galya would watch his lashes quivering, and see his eyes reflecting the swift passage of thought. It seemed incredible that those eyes could not see, so alive were the clear, unblemished pupils.

When the day's work was over she would read what she had written and he would listen tensely,his brow wrinkled.

"Why are you frowning, Comrade Korchagin? It is good, isn't it?"

"No, Galya, it is bad."

The pages he did not like he rewrote himself. Hampered by the narrow strip of the stencil he would sometimes lose his patience and fling it from him. And then, furious with life for having robbed him of his eyesight, he would break his pencils and bite his lips until the blood came. As the work drew to a close, forbidden emotions began more often to burst the bonds of his ever-vigilant will: sadness and all those simple human feelings, warm and tender, to which everyone but himself had the right. But he knew that were he to succumb to a single one of them theconsequences would be tragic.

At last the final chapter was written. For the next few days Galya read the book aloud to Pavel.

Tomorrow the manuscript would be sent to Leningrad, to the Cultural Department of the Regional Party Committee. If the book was approved there, it would be turned over to the publishers — and then. .. .

His heart beat anxiously at the thought. If all was well, the new life would begin, a life won by years of weary, unremitting toil.

The fate of the book would decide Pavel's own fate. If the manuscript was rejected that would be the end for him. If, on the other hand, it was found to be bad only in part, if its defects could be remedied by further work, he would launch a new offensive.

His mother took the parcel with the manuscript to the post office. Days of anxious waiting began.

Never in his life had Pavel waited in such anguished suspense for a letter as he did now. He lived from the morning to the evening post. But no news came from Leningrad.

The continued silence of the publishers began to look ominous. From day to day the presentiment of disaster mounted, and Pavel admitted to himself that total rejection of his book would finish him. That, he could not endure. There would be no longer any reason to live.

At such moments he remembered the park on the hill overlooking the sea, and he asked himself the same question over and over again:

"Have you done everything you can to break out of the steel bonds and return to the ranks, to make your life useful?"

And he had to answer: "Yes, I believe I have done everything!"

At last, when the agony of waiting had become well-nigh unbearable, his mother, who had been suffering from the suspense no less than her son, came running into the room with the cry:

"News from Leningrad!"

It was a telegram from the Regional Committee. A terse message on a telegraph form: "Novel heartily approved. Turned over to publishers. Congratulations on your victory."

His heart beat fast. His cherished dream was realised! The steel bonds have been burst, and now,armed with a new weapon, he had returned to the fighting ranks and to life.

保尔和达雅到了莫斯科，在一个机关的档案库里住了几天。这个机关的首长又帮助保尔住进了一所专科医院。

现在保尔才明白，当一个人身体健康，充满青春活力的时候，坚强是比较简单和容易做到的事，只有生活像铁环那样把你紧紧箍住的时候，坚强才是光荣的业绩。

从保尔住进档案库那个晚上到现在，已经一年半了。这十八个月里他遭受的痛苦是难以形容的。

在医院里，阿韦尔巴赫教授坦率地告诉保尔，恢复视力是不可能的。如果将来有一天炎症能够消失，可以试着给他做做瞳孔手术。建议他目前先进行外科治疗，消除炎症。

他们征求保尔的意见，保尔表示，只要医生认为是必要的，他都同意。

当保尔躺在手术台上，手术刀割开颈部，切除一侧甲状旁腺的时候，死神的黑翅膀曾经先后三次触到他身上。然而，保尔的生命力十分顽强。达雅在外面提心吊胆地守候，手术过后，她看见丈夫虽然像死人一样惨白，但是仍然很有生气，并且像平常一样，温柔而安详。

“你放心好了，小姑娘。要我进棺材不那么容易。我还要活下去，而且要大干一场，偏要跟那些医学权威的结论捣捣乱。他们对我的病情做的诊断都正确，但是硬说我已经百分之百地丧失了劳动力，那是完全错误的。咱们还是走着瞧吧。”

保尔坚定地选择了一条道路，决心通过这条道路回到新生活建设者的行列。

冬天过去了，春天推开了紧闭着的窗户。失血过多的保尔挺过了最后一次手术，他觉得医院里再也呆不下去了。十几个月来，看的是周围人们的种种痛苦，听的是垂死病人的呻吟和哀号，这比忍受自身的病痛还要困难得多。

医生建议他再做一次手术，他冷冷地一口拒绝说：“算了，我做够了。我已经把一部分血献给了科学，剩下的留给我做别的用吧。”

当天，保尔给中央委员会写了一封信，请中央委员会帮助他在莫斯科安下家来，因为他的妻子就在这里工作，而且他再流浪下去也没有好处。这是他生平第一次向党请求帮助。

莫斯科市苏维埃收到他的信以后，拨给他一个房间。于是他离开了医院，唯一的希望是永远不再回到这里来。

房子在克鲁泡特金大街一条僻静的胡同里，很简陋，但是在保尔看来，这已经是最高的享受了。夜间醒来的时候，他常常不能相信，他已经离开了医院，而且离得远远的了。

达雅已经转为正式党员。她顽强地工作着，尽管个人生活中有那么大的不幸，她并没有落在其他突击手的后面。群众对这个沉默寡言的女工表示了很大的信任，选举她当了厂委会的委员。保尔为妻子成了布尔什维克而感到自豪，这大大减轻了他的痛苦。

有一次巴扎诺娃到莫斯科出差，前来探望保尔。他们谈了很久。保尔热情洋溢地告诉她，他选择了一条道路，不久的将来就可以重新回到战士的行列。

巴扎诺娃注意到保尔两鬓已经出现了白发，她低声对他说：“我看得出，您是经受了不少痛苦。您仍然没有失去那永不熄灭的热情。还有什么比这更可贵呢？您做了五年准备，现在您决定动笔了，这很好。不过，您怎么写呢？”

保尔笑了笑，安慰她说：“明天他们给我送一块有格的板子来，是用硬纸板刻出来的。没有这东西我没法写。写写就会串行。我琢磨了好长时间，才想出这么个办法——在硬纸板上刻出一条条空格，写的时候，铅笔就不会出格了。看不见所写的东西，写起来当然挺困难，但并不是不可能。这一点，我是深信不疑的。有好长一段时间怎么也写不好，现在我慢慢写，每个字母都仔细写，结果相当不错。”

保尔开始工作了。

他打算写一部中篇小说，描写科托夫斯基的英勇的骑兵师，书名不用考虑就出来了：《暴风雨的儿女》。

从这天起，保尔把全部精力投入了这本书的创作。他缓慢地写了一行又一行，写了一页又一页。他忘记了一切，完全被人物的形象迷住了，他第一次尝到了创作的痛苦，那些鲜明难忘的情景清晰地浮现在眼前，他却找不到恰当的词句表达，写出的东西苍白无力，缺少火一般的激情。

已经写好的东西，他必须逐字逐句地记住，否则，线索一断，工作就会停顿。母亲惴惴不安地注视着儿子的工作。

写作过程中，保尔往往要凭记忆整页整页地，甚至整章整章地背诵，母亲有时觉得他好像疯了。儿子写作的时候，她不敢走近他，只有乘着替他把落在地上的手稿拣起来的机会，才胆怯地说：“你干点别的不好吗，保夫鲁沙？哪有你这样的，写起来就没完没了……”

对母亲的担心，他总是会心地笑一笑，并且告诉老人家，他还没有到完全“发疯”的程度。

小说已经写完了三章。保尔把它寄到敖德萨，给科托夫斯基师的老战友们看，征求他们的意见。他很快就收到了回信，大家都称赞他的小说写得好。但是原稿在寄回来的途中被邮局丢失了。六个月的心血白费了。这对保尔是一个很大的打击。他非常懊悔没有复制一份，而把唯一的一份手稿寄出去了。他把邮件丢失的事告诉了列杰尼奥夫。

“你怎么这么粗心大意呢？别生气了，现在骂也没用了。重新开始吧。”

“哪能不气愤呢，英诺肯季·帕夫洛维奇！六个月心血的结晶一下子给偷去了。我每天都要紧张地劳动八个小时啊！这帮寄生虫，真该死！”

列杰尼奥夫极力安慰他。

一切不得不重新开始。列杰尼奥夫给他弄到一些纸，帮助他把写好的稿子用打字机打出来。一个半月之后，第一章又脱稿了。

跟保尔住一套房间的是一家姓阿列克谢耶夫的。他家的大儿子亚历山大是本市一个区的团委书记。亚历山大有一个十八岁的妹妹，叫加莉亚，已经在工厂的工人学校毕业了。这是个朝气蓬勃的姑娘。保尔让母亲跟她商量，看她是不是愿意帮助他，做他的“秘书”。加莉亚非常高兴地答应了，满脸笑容，热情地走了过来。她听说保尔正在写一部小说，就说：“柯察金同志，我非常愿意帮助您。这跟给我爸爸写枯燥的住宅卫生条例完全不一样。”

从这天起，写作就以加倍的速度向前进行了。一个月的工夫写了那么多，连保尔也感到惊讶。加莉亚深切地同情保尔，积极主动地帮助他工作。她的铅笔在纸上沙沙地响着，遇到特别喜爱的地方，她总要反复念上几遍，并且感到由衷的高兴。在这所房子里，几乎只有她一个人相信保尔的工作是有意义的，其余的人都认为保尔是白费劲，只是因为什么也不能干了，又闲不住，才找点事来打发日子。

因公外出的列杰尼奥夫回到了莫斯科，他读了小说的头几章以后，说：“坚持干下去，朋友！胜利一定属于我们。还有更大的喜悦在等待着你，保尔同志。我坚信，你归队的理想很快就能实现。不要失去信心，孩子。”

这位老同志看到保尔精力十分充沛，满意地走了。

加莉亚经常来，她的铅笔在纸上沙沙地响，一行一行的字句，在不断地增加，追述着难忘的往事。每当保尔凝神深思，沉浸在回忆中的时候，加莉亚就看到他的睫毛在颤动，他的眼神随着思路的转换不断地变化，简直令人难以相信他的双目已经失明：你瞧，那对清澈无瑕的瞳孔是多么有生气啊。

一天的工作结束了，加莉亚把记下来的东西念给保尔听，她发现保尔全神贯注地倾听着，时而皱起眉头。

“您干吗皱眉头呢，柯察金同志？不是写得挺好嘛！”

“不，加莉亚，写得不好。”

他认为写得不成功的地方，就亲自动手重写。有时候他实在忍受不了格子板的狭窄框框的束缚，就扔下不写了。他恨透了这夺去他视力的生活，盛怒之下常常把铅笔折断，把嘴唇咬得出血。

忧伤，以及常人的各种热烈的或者温柔的普通感情，几乎人人都可以自由抒发，唯独保尔没有这个权利，它们被永不松懈的意志禁锢着。但是工作越接近尾声，这些感情越经常地冲击他，力图摆脱意志的控制。要是他屈服于这些感情中的任何一种，听任它发作，就会发生悲惨的结局。

达雅常常深夜才从工厂回到家里，跟保尔的母亲小声交谈几句，就上床去睡了。

最后一章写成了。加莉亚花了几天时间把小说给保尔通读了一遍。

明天就要把书稿寄到列宁格勒，请州委文化宣传部审阅。

如果他们同意给这部小说开“出生证”，就会把它送交出版社，那么一来……

想到这里，他的心不安地跳动起来。那么一来……新的生活就要开始，这是多年紧张而顽强的劳动换来的啊。

书的命运决定着保尔的命运。如果书稿被彻底否定，那他的日子就到头了。如果失败是局部的，通过进一步加工还可以挽救，他一定会发起新的进攻。

母亲把沉甸甸的包裹送到了邮局。紧张的等待开始了。保尔一生中还从来没有像现在这样痛苦而焦急地等待过来信。

他从早班信盼到晚班信。列宁格勒一直没有回音。

出版社的沉默逐渐成为一种威胁。失败的预感一天比一天强烈，保尔意识到，一旦小说遭到无条件的拒绝，那也就是他的灭亡。那时，他就没法再活下去了。活下去也没有意义了。

此时此刻，郊区滨海公园的一幕又浮现在眼前，他一次又一次地问自己：“为了冲破铁环，重返战斗行列，使你的生命变得有益于人民，你尽了一切努力了吗？”

每次的回答都是：“是的，看来是尽了一切努力了。”

好多天过去了，正当期待已经变得无法忍受的时候，同儿子一样焦虑的母亲一面往屋里跑，一面激动地喊道：“列宁格勒来信了！！！”

这是州委打来的电报。电报上只有简单几个字：

小说备受赞赏，即将出版，祝贺成功。

他的心欢腾地跳动起来。多年的愿望终于实现了！铁环已经被砸碎，他拿起新的武器，重新回到战斗的行列，开始了新的生活。
